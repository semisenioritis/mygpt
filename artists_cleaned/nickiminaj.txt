[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd m nage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know 
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me 
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money  Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only[Intro: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Beyonc ]
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow

Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let-let that ho know (He in love)
He in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin' 
You bitches will never get what I be earnin' (Uh)
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40, I am a rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that
Nature  Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser
Rrr! Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy  Can't say your S's and shit, uh

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit "
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a m nage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

You know I'm all 'bout them dollars

So I said, "Fuck it, I'm in"
He wanna cut like a trim
And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted
I'm poppin', I'm uninvited
I said, "Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it"
I ride his **** in a circle
I turn Stefan into Urkel
I go arounds and arounds and I'ma go down in slow motion
The-then I pick it up, look at it

Yellow brick road, he said that I am a wiz at it

12 cylinders in the coupe
I get dome with the chrome, no tellin' when I'ma shoot
I just bang, bang, bang, real killas is in my group
Gorillas is in my unit, vacationin' where it's humid
And I shine, shine, shine, got diamonds all in my cubans
I'm in LA Times more than when niggas lootin'
And my flow spit crack, I think that nigga usin'
He done bodied everybody, in closing, these bitches losin'
Usin', usin' up, a bitch movin'

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here  Are you here right now, huh 
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh 
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup  Is you here right now 
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now 
Uhh, do you hear me  I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here  Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom  Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name    Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot

I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse 
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first  I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

Put 'em on time out, and never call these niggas
Pussy like girls; damn, is my pussy gay

Pussy this, pussy that, pussy taken
Pussy ride dick, like she a Jamaican
Pussy stay warm, pussy on vacation
You loose bitches need a pussy renovation
You could eat it with a pussy reservation
Pussy 'bout to get a standin' ovation
Clap, clap-clap for this pussy, nigga
But I can't give this pussy to a pussy nigga
Aw, man, slow down
I'ma get you something that you could hold down
But I can't give you head, I'm too ill for that
I'ma make a movie still Kill Bill for that
Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga  Custom done !
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot  Bust me down !
You the same clown nigga, that was runnin' me down !
Now you all up in the sauce, cause you wanna be down !
I said, "Rule Number 1 to be a boss ass bitch"
Never let a clown nigga, try to play you
If he play you, then "Rule number 2:
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em yes men
And get a dick pic, and then you press send
And send a red heart, and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends, love how your pussy taste"
And that's rule 3: I'm the school T
My wrist look like, I am a jewel thief
But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese, and grill my swordfish

If he catch my drift, he could catch my jizz
I be out in Cali, runnin' all my businesses
I be out in Cali, watchin' back my Christmas vids
Every time I fuck 'em, yes, I tell him, "This is his"
Looked down at it, and I said, "This is big!"
Man, my game so cold I said, "This is rigged"
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell 'em bitches, cross their T's and dot their I
I-I-I-I-I-I- I came back, bitches' flows still boring
I said, "Damn, man, go back to whoring"
You know I still lead the league, in scoring
You know I'm still bad, and I'm still foreign
I'ma give bitches time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York, Knickerbock
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot, oh
But on the real, I'm in album mode
I just dropped this freestyle, 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound

[Interlude]
I hear you...
When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
Cause I'm comin' for you
Ooh, ooh...

[Bridge]
Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it  I go rich bitch off
Cause you know my style gettin' bit, ripped-off
When I'm at the restaurant: rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, I got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it  I go rich bitch off
And you know my style gettin' bit, ripped-off
Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

Yo
People'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on 'em

Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"

All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (Uh)
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (Okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (Okay)
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch," dick up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch

[Verse 3]
When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence
When it's clear they bite me, I'm flattered they like me
I don't wanna check bitches, tell 'em wear their Nikes
Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings
That's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz
Uh, Barbie white picket Barbie fence
All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it  (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it  (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, "Make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you "
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas " She say, "What about them niggas "
You right, what you doing tonight 
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else  She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through

Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it 
Baby, it's your world, ain't it

All the dope boys gon' feel her
Flow so sick I need a healer, fuck is my MAC
Concealer  I be out in Queens on the back of four-
Whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers, I'm a big deal
That's why I get more head, than a pigtail
Put some ranch out, I m gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entree
'Cause they be thinking they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin', like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin', like a can of brew
Listen, you should buy a sixteen, 'cause I write it good
That 808 woof-woof, 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood 

[Chorus]
Now, if you see a itty-bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "As-Salaam-Alaikum"
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em
And if you see a itty-bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "As-Salaam-Alaikum"
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em

[Interlude]
It's like I just single-handedly annihilated, you know, every rap bitch in the building
Like, like, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie
Like, I mean, I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like, give it up! It's me!
I win! You lose Hahahahahahaha
Oh, shit! Hahaha, yo

[Refrain]
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

[Outro]
Hahahahahaha

Now listen, in addition to pickin' my fruit out

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her

I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Who the fuck told you
That Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat 
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' layup
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I come out, I ain t ever with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'ma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious (vicious)
Every time I fuck him, I say "Whose is it "
Yo! Who the fuck told 'em that, "They was like Nicki  Oh no, bitches didn't!"
I'ma give bitches a minute of shine, then I'll tell 'em good riddance (good riddance)
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know, cause these bitches my sons
Yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign, and then I said, "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion, I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
B-b-b-b-but, bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal 
Tell Justin Timberlake, that I am comin' for Jessica Biel
Bitch, I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomorrow
Doors go up, 'cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink, just so I could take pictures, while you rented yours
H-H-H-Hell of a ticket, h-h-h-h-hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but let's be precise
'Cause if she pretty then watch it, 'cause I'ma be fuckin' ya wife

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thugga tenant
100 bands at a time, I fronted you bands, but you
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy, I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof, all the niggas' dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother

Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin' 
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go[Intro]

Let's go get a wave

Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches, like me, is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three  Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more

And I ain't payin' my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Dancehall life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now spend all your money, 'cause today payday
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G

You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off
Get it, get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off
Bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years, guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt 
Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought you knew better, do your fucking research
You ain t know, this the no rip zone
This the you can't beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt s home
I like bad bitches, 'cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up, ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch, I m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wan' see her
Muhfuckas flexin', muhfuckas actin'
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick

Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'ma write ya, you on the road  I'ma Skype ya
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease

Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year  We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more  I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

Yo, he in my startin' five, he get his city live

I'm tryna clap him like somebody told him, "Gimme five"
I'ma be a half an hour, but I told him, "Gimme five"
I'm tryna dance on him, blow my advance on 'em
I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
I like his hang time, he said his head right
I said go all the way down and then head right
I watch him fuck it up, look at him luckin' up
I said, "You need some thick skin, baby, suck it up"
He go insane on it, I put my fame on it

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been 
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, "Why, God "
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod 
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not 
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on 
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone 
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot 
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me  Overnight 
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why 
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask 
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on  They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody wanna buy a heart 
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side 

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody  Anybody 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time 
But you waited

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody  Anybody 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy 
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love 

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Its a heart for sale, who's buying 
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying 
I don't care who's lying[Verse 1]
Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki )
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body )
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype  Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye 
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yonc  
You got about three stacks, now you Andr  
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that 
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

[Interlude]
I see ya, I see you
I see ya, I see you

[Outro]
To my surprise, I saw you in my eyes
The nights I cried, repented of the lies
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, burn, baby (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)[Intro]
Uh, yaow, yaow

[Verse 1]
I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon bitch, you see where Brad at 
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo SB, what the fuck's good 
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

[Chorus]
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe

[Verse 2]
Uh, look Bubbles, go back to ya' habitat
MJ gone and I ain't havin' that
How you gonna be the stunt double to the nigga monkey 
Top of that I'm in the Phantom lookin' hella chonky
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up in the Porsche, but it ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP
Who's gassin' this hoe  BP 
Hmm... thinks
One, two, three, do the Nicki Minaj blink
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody

[Chorus]
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe

[Verse 3]
If you cute, then your crew can roll
If you sexy, eat my cucka roll
Put ya' cape on, you a super hoe
2012, I'm at the Super Bowl

[Bridge]
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me then she coulda prolly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me then she could've probably came back
You a stupid hoe, you a stupid hoe, you a stupid hoe
And I ain't hit that note, but fuck you stupid hoe, fuck you stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe

[Outro]
I am the female Weezy[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Mmm, uhh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ain't yellin' cut, when it's shootin' time
Sign up, it's recruitin' time
Big wigs, with a suit and tie
And them big things got two inside
Fuck wrong wit' these ho niggas 
Don't do coke, I don't blow niggas
I don't tell niggas, I show niggas
And it's never less than like four niggas
(Four-four) Four wings and some french fries
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga
He telling and he hiding
But real niggas still catch a nigga
Cop Raris  I don't test drive 'em
Home theaters, can't Best Buy 'em
These niggas that I roll with
Don't let a single thing get by 'em
King pins and them drug lords
Chi-Town, no gun laws
Broke bitches that talk shit 
Now them the bitches I stunt for
Malcolm X daughter, came at me
Lookin' ass niggas ain't happy
Rolled out with some Latin Kings
And some eses in 'em plain khakis
Smack bitches, no smack cam
Closed fists, no back hands
Pop pussy on a hand stand
They suckin' dick like it's band camp
Call Webb and then call Nitti
Queens niggas in, it's all hoodies
Kidnappin' and then rob niggas
Call D-Roc for a biggie
Pussy ass little rap niggas
I fucked with real trap niggas
Pop star, icon
But I send niggas, come snatch niggas
I'm with EBK, you on EBT
Got a black nine, call it BET
School niggas, get a GED
And I tease niggas, make em B-E-G
Got a money fetish, I'ma fly to Venice
Got a big house, I can play some tennis
Lil Herb, what's good 
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
1-50, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I'm a young nigga, I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
I'ma stay 100 'til I'm six under
Matter fact, I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me
I'm on Roc Block with a new semi
And a blue Bentley, it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a 40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly  Straight killers
I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

[Outro: G Herbo & Nicki Minaj]
Gang, gang, gang shit man
You already know how I'm rocking man
This is G Herbo, shout out Nicki Minaj, you already know man
SB just gave me the .9 with the green beam
Just give me the green light
Letting niggas have it man
We pulling up anywhere wetting shit man
Got 50s in them TECs, 50s in them MACs man
30s in them Glocks, 17 shot Berettas, all that shit man
Sawed offs, pumps man what you want 
How you want it, where you want
When you want it man, let's get it
And I ride dolo from state to state
Even when I ain't 150 man Chiraq all the way to Queens
Let's get it
Uh-huh, I always got a trick up my sleeve
I might give you a new trick every week
'Til this album drop, I don't know
I figured they want some more, I'ma give you some more
Ask Webb if I wasn't taking them trips, with 'em nigga!
Chea![Intro]
Zaytoven
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Everytime I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album 
Who had Kanye saying,  She a problem  
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column 
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million 
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though  You niggas don't know it yet 
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying  Is these bitches trying me 
They think it's sweet  Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list  It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said,  Thank you 
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches  BJ 
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (My name)
My name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it 
Cash Money, getting six albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you  That's a big problem

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

Quiet, ain't no back talk[Chorus: Ciara]
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
 I know I m cute, I know I m fly
You ask me why  'Cause I m the shit! 
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Beat em' like they stole some, beat em' like they stole some
All this booty here got 'em dreaming, lemme hold some
Let me, let me hear that boy, let me, let me wear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car, and let me steer that boy
Real big pretty titty, shut down every city
If you want the kid kitty, gotta get the key from me
All new everything, plus pay the rent for me
If we in the wilderness, niggas pitch the tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get me bodied
Long hair, no makeup, doing pilates
Those niggas don't step on my damn Zanottis
All them bitches my sons but who's the Daddy 
I graduate with honors, I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a freestyle, then I got a shout out from Obama
Yes, yes, I am ill, I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons, birth control, I am on the pill
What I gotta do  What I gotta do to 'em 
Step up in the club, everybody like who them 
Girls girls, me and my girls
What you done did  I need some referrals
Motherfuckers know I m the shit, legit
And if a motherfucker don t, he can suck my dick
I tell 'em, "Everybody else is my opposite!"
I put 'em on the game, give 'em five percent

[Chorus: Ciara]
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
 I know I m cute, I know I m fly
You ask me why  'Cause I m the shit! 
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime

You ask me why  'Cause I m the shit! 

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I m like really famous, I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos, all this fame is heinous
Lemme, lemme hear that boy, lemme, lemme wear that boy
All this money coming in, but I never share that, boy
No lipstick, no lashes though
But I got a real big ol' ratchet, though
I said dude, yo dude, you packing dough
He said he want a good box like Pacquiao
I said, "Well, my name Nicki and it s nice to meet you"
If you really wanna know, I ll give you my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate whack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas
How you gon' break that  How you gon' fake that 
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake high
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can t keep up  They molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch, with the cashes flow
Looking at me like it s my fault
Trying to take sneak pictures with they iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that s what young Harriet died for

[Chorus: Ciara]
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
 I know I m cute, I know I m fly
You ask me why  'Cause I m the shit! 
I m the shit with no makeup, don t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
 I know I m cute, I know I m fly
You ask me why  'Cause I m the shit! [Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone  Do you need someone 
Is it too late to talk  Did I wait too long 
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three  Three words that you're missing 

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where did you go  Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go  I think that I know

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what 
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin' 
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it  All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where did you go  Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go  I think that I know

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

[Outro: Jessie Ware]
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o[Chorus]
I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you, he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do  You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot  Who the fuck was kiddin' you 
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory 
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon App tit
Used to get real hype off a half a mil'
Used to get real high off a half a pill
We don't pay niggas to front like they like my shit
We don't pay niggas to come in and write my shit, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on
Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on
G6 flow, all Louis V carry-ons

[Chorus]
I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you, he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me

[Bridge]
You made me, you made me, yeah
You made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
On blood, you made me, you made me, yeah, yeah, yeah
You made me (Okay), you made me (Haha, uh)

[Verse 2]
Yo, you made me do it, hoe, I told you, get low (Told you get low)
I'm popping tens, but they gotta be yellow
I'm New York Nick, I'm ballin', where Carmelo  (O.K. 'Melo)
I'm wavy, word to Shawty L-O, hello
How your jacket say Porsche and you never rode a Porsche 
How you supposed to make the quota when you never went North 
How the fuck you got Ferraris when you never went sport 
All that hoopin' and hollerin', still ain't scorin' on the court (Rrrr)

[Bridge]
You made me, you made me, yeah
You made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
On blood, you made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
You made me (Okay), you made me (Haha)

[Verse 3]
Ayy yo, look at what they made me do, they made me do
Switched the foreign on 'em, navy blue to baby blue
Look at how they started pussy poppin' when 80 flew
All my niggas move that Britney, Ari, yeah, Katy, too
Niggas gassed on the really though, gas I pumped them
Straight trash on the really, yo, yes, I dumped him
Push the limits, I'm a pushy bitch, yes, I bumped him
Pushed past being filthy rich, ask I trumped them
'Cause I scare her, scare her, my biggest era, era
Never been clearer, clearer, don't force it, Farrah, Farrah
Because you'll never be me, that's word to Bella, Gigi
Dolce Gabbana, DG, pretty gang rated PG (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on
Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on
G6 flow, all Louis V carry-ons

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this $250 on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything  Well, let's have a chat
A-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga 
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He said, "Baby, everyday we ballin'," I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch"
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Lil mama said she only fuckin' on a rich dick
I cum in her face and tell her, "Now you lookin' rich, bitch"
Her friend in the other room, can I get a witness 
We could have some rich sex, cannot have no rich kids
Facts, all my bitches have no limits
Fucked her in a helicopter, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in a drop top, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with, now she screamin', "Why I'm with him "
Damn, lil mama said she only suckin' on a rich dick
Make you put your money where your mouth at, that's some lipstick
Let's fuck on the money 'fore we count that, that's some rich shit
Pussy smell like money when I'm down there, that some Nic shit
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)

If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Brinx Billions]
I don't even know where we going these days, where we landing

Hahaha, rrrrr![Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me  What you telling me 
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before 
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

Used to work hard, just to get half back

Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jourdan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest 
You the motherfucking fairest, Nicki

I'm who they wishin' to be
These hoes is on the 'Gram, Nicki pitchin' a ki'

Used to work hard, just to get half back

Vintage Herm s by Jean Paul Gaultier

I run the point, you bitches just go cheer
Uh, look at my knockoffs, I told 'em knock it off
Anything that Nicki do, you know they knock it off
Put my crown on again, and I'ma knock it off
Anything with Nicki in it, they gon' pocket off
I mean profit off, my plug drop it off
You see them copyin' my hair, tell 'em, "Chop it off"
Uh, bad gyal whip, the top is off
You nuh see him downgrade when mi drop 'em off
Uh, I ain't never play the ho position
I ain't ever have to strip to get the pole position
Hoes is dissin'  Okay, these hoes is wishin'
You're in no position to come for O's position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position

Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, "Please, boy"
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

Always sayin' what somebody won't do 
Who the fuck gon  pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty

Who the fuck gon' beat him with the .22 if he don't lose the attitude
And run off with his credit cards, too

I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth
Who knew what you d do if I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool, I, I'm not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide 
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you
So I lied, I lied, I lied

[Chorus]
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

It, it, it, it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I, I'm not livin' life

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (oh, yeah, I'm not livin', I'm not livin, ooh)

You, you hoes bugging, repel that

'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do

Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

Young ma, it's the female Jay

Plus I got the title queen stream, press replay
Testified for my nigga to the DA's face
One time for this super old PA case
I'm still schoolin' bitches like GA State
And I'ma still ball, call me T.D. Jakes
Bars for years, niggas thought I did a bid
I'm draggin' these hoes like Harambe did the kid
Shut the club down, it was poppin' then we slid
I call my pussy liquor, I ain't talkin' 'bout a swig
But if you thirsty, I own a sangria
Shout out to Fox Brown, I don't mean Pam Grier
I got a sign that say "Lames can't hang here"
Bats eyelashes, blank stare
He be like, "You came ," I be like, "You came "
He say my ride game smoother than a Muslanne
Every time they count me out I be like, "You sane "
Bitch I come back like Jordan in his flu game
Every time I shoot it, it be all net
I give him ostrich, that mean all neck
Anything he need, I got on deck
And go to sleep playin' with his ballsack

Got a bitch lookin' like Chanel ads
Chillin' out in dem Beverly Hill pads
I gave bitches time but they still mad
Si, est  loco
If my bitch don't like you, yo tampoco
Me Dorothy and you Toto
Now put some marshmallows in my cocoa
[Sips] Mmm.. Tastes good... Hahah...
Yo, don't ever talk about Nicki in the past-tense
Unless I fly pass that ass in a fast Bent'
Fuck outta here you dumb bitch
You know I'm pretty, and I'm witty, and I'm dumb rich
You throw shade, but I sun bitch
And now you know what I'ma say, you my son, bitch

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly[Verse 1]
Am I just a fool 
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl 
So young and naive to think you were

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Chorus]
(And now the people)
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I queen of fools 
Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you 
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I keep thinking you are
The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

[Chorus + Violin Solo]
And now the people
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Mo t
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City

Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated

All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again

Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Bridge]
So good, so real, so good, yeah

Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you "

A couple of you niggas still owe me
You asked for the G.O.A.T. so they sent me, sleeze
Tryna lay low, don't tempt me, sleeze
Thirty in the clip will be empty, sleeze
You bitches still my sons, learn your As and Bs
Leave the hate train in the station please

Made her change her mind in the judge chamber, sleeze
The MAC's on the line, I ain't talking 'bout the PC
I'm the biggest fish in the pan, I'll do you greasy
All he gotta do is call, I'm in my T-shirt and my drawers
Face down, ass up, I'm already on all fours
Suck his dick through his shorts
Then I ride him like a whore
I mean a horse, I'm a boss
Yeah, I got the juice and I'm takin' him on a tour
Imitating Nicki while your ghostwriter dissin' me
Leave for two weeks, I got all of my babies missin' me
Never gon' fall, never not gon' ball
And I keep my nigga bustin' like a draco
He always come back, Big Draco
Still going bad on you stank hoes

[Outro]
Uh, haha mmm
Ahahaha, ahahaha!

I had to, uh, get back in my bag
I might drop a freestyle every, um, week 'til the thing-thing come
The label hit me said they want the fifth thing-thing, I got in the studio, I did the fifth thing-thing
And then they say "You know, it's time to drop your single" I said "Noooo"
You know radio already tried to blackball a bitch
It's all good 'cause when you a legend, when you legendary
You shine no matter what
They get compared to me no matter what
They asked for the GOAT so I came through, bitch
But look, on some real shit, I'm 'bout to go on tour with, um, Juice WRLD
In Europe, shout-out to my fans in Europe
Uhm, I'm fucking three to four times a day, I'm feeling real good

And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals

[Verse 1]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
"S" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me "mama, lil' mama," I call him "baby"

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
"S" on my chest, let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon

Me, I'm just me, me, I'm just real, me, I'm that bitch that be footing the bill
Only a real nigga could cop a feel, credit card blacker than that nigga Seal
25 million to broker the deal, Jewish my lawyer, he Kosher the deal
And I am still poppin' them pills, I don't give a fuck how you bitches feel
Jealousy, jealousy that's how you feel  I am still living in Beverly Hills
Tell 'em to chill, tell 'em to chill, tell all them people, my wrist is on chill
Bitches can't beat me, they ain't got the skill, eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill
Look up to Jada, I love her and Will, bitches my sons, but they not in my will

Pinkprint hot, it should be in some slippers
Niggas know me, yeah

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I don't fuck with you niggas, I own the Clippers
I own some homes, I own my own liquor
Bitches is bitter, my titties is bigger, you bitches my sons, I need a babysitter
I am the dream, on the dream team, I am Olajuwon, I am Hakeem
Dul Jabbar, I am Kareem, I am the Queen because I'm a machine
You are not ready, you are not seasoned, go against me I say, "Fix it Jesus"
Thinking they hot, talk shit a lot but when they shit drop, I say "Fix it Jesus"
Oh, your shit, ain't gold!
Word, to my bank roll

Niggas know me, yeah[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame  Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I 
What you call a crib in the sky  Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing 
Don t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)

[Verse 4: Nas]
What up, Nicki  It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)

Them dead, d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d, presidents, presidents[Verse 1]
They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs 
Did I really prophecy every thing I do 
But before I continue, let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame "
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad  You should see them
Burn an L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad  You should see them
Burn an L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with  Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval 
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here  'Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad  You should see them
Burn an L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go; might pick up a ho
Might give conversation, if you kick up the dough
Never mind my money, never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday, two milli; "Super Bass," triple plat'
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sittin' with Anna, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Front row at Oscar de la Renta, posture
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lock out, where the fuck is your roster 
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But, this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Verse 2]
7-Up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo
But don't tell them I said it, let's keep it on the D-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets 
Flyin' spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I styling  I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waiting, 'cause them pictures will sell
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

[Interlude]
Dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, yeah

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

Yo, ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we  bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for, make mistakes though

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride (Ride, ride)
What is the hurry  It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time (Time, time)

Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me 
We ain't goin' nowhere like tanks is on E
We still gettin' money, what bank it's gon' be 
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me
So where them big boys with all of that  (Ayy)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
And we could drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is "Don't lose" (Kyuh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride (Ride, ride)
What is the hurry  It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time (Time, time)

"Hello, may I speak to Tunechi " May I ask who's callin' 
Everybody got the juice without a glass to pour it
I want my cake and eat it, too, and after that, I'm starving
I feel like Adam, but I'm 'bout to eat a apple on you, uh
Rollie on the right side, now y'all on my time
Please get off my dick before it turn into a pipe bomb
Eyes lookin' like I'm somewhere outta Taiwan
Faded as fuck as always, hi mom

No ball, but peep game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches 
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em

My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday

I just got 10 million bucks for shit that I ain't even do yet
You spent your money but I ain't say I was your boo yet
You got your feelings hurt, I ain't really mean to do that
I'm just a bad bitch, I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we ll never say, "Good morning"
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home 'til the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flauntin' everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores, I get everything that fits me
Chanel mink slides and shades so they don't know it's me

[Chorus]
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say, "Oh, I got those," I said, "No, it's not those"
I don't fuck with birds, but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby, I'm a gunna
When I say baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil' like Weezy on the come-up (Uh)

[Chorus]
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray (Yeah)

Had the power to be the best B in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me 
You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly, yo
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick, bitch, Andy
'Ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
Your game over, bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel  They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki, what you think 
I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in

It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest

Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest

Ayo, queen, got the customers out here, man
They lovin' this shit, man, they lovin' this shit, man
Where you at, man  Where you at, man 
We need you here, man, I know you in Miami

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, you could take all of my bitches out to Abu Dhabi
Let one of my besties confiscate your Maserati
You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen s like it s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it, all my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy don't it
(It look easy don't it, it look easy don't it)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Outro: Patty Duke]
Yo, Nick, what's good  This ya boy Patty Duke
Man, you already know we got shit movin' out here, man
That these bitches ain't fuckin' wit' you
They ain't fuckin' wit' the team, man, all of 'em, man
'Cause niggas know that bag heavy, boy, that bag heavy
Niggas get fuckin' dropped 'round here
Queens get the money, man
Never fakin' it, always makin' it, ya heard 
Iconic shit, man[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'  Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you 

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you 
How do you

[Verse 2]
What are we doin'  Could you see through me 
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who, me "
And you say, "No, you," and I say, "Screw you"
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason 
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you 
How do you 
How do you 
How do you 
How do you 
You see right through me
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you  (Do that)
How do you  (Do that)
How do you  (Do that)
How do you  (Do that)
How do you 

[Bridge]
Stop (Ooh)
Stop (Ooh)
Won't you just stop lookin' through me  'Cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it (You see right)

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you do that shit 
How do you 
How do you 
How do you 
How do you

You see right through me

Um, let me think, what could I do to kick it off 
How bout I cum all on your dick and then I lick it off 
I mean it's something so funny when it get soft
I like to play with it, squeeze it like a stress ball
He say he like to hear the sound of me slurpin' it
Turn off his phone cause them hoes keep churpin' it
Tell me that I get the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it, I can be his ol' girl
Fuck I look like turning down some head 
I mean that's sorta like a bird turning down some bread 
You can eat it like a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet, I'm a freak, I love to beat, just don't get none in my sheets
Every time I pop the coochie, Gucci start chokin' me
Now I'm kinda scared I got a feelin' Gucci stalkin' me

Fuck with presidents, I am Nicki Lewinsky

Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more to come
Friends tell 'em more to come, we gon have some orgy fun, Yeaaaah

You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear  Smack my ass, grab my neck, got em cummin' everywhere
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shopping sprees he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)

All I did was let him eat my... coochie!

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me  Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it  The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (yeah)
She told me that I had talent, got on her knees
And prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day
I don't know if I could be that (yeah)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you
And tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)
Thought I would have a son for you but now it's official
It's over and I can't let you go (oh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like
I'm dying real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt
And when I'm angry (kyuh)
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you  That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 3]
Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young
Mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me
I wasn't ready for you
But how the   would they know what I was ready to do 
And of course, it wasn't your fault (no)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying
"Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here " (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)

What the fuck you smiling for 
And what they put you on the panel for 
Where you gettin' money from 
Ayo Twist, where you get that Bentley from 
Clap, clap, clap, make it go around like a lap
Now put it in my lap
Let me see your crack, like the trap

I like percocets, I like to keep 'em hidden in my Birkin bag
Ass so fat, damn I'mma hurt 'em bad
It's showtime bitch, tell me break a leg
Couple Bushwick niggas, that'll break your leg
Push you off the balcony, and don't break a ledge
Put your hand up, now it's time to make a pledge
You'll never catch me, in a lightskin nigga bed
I'ma always keep the hammer, nigga fuck a sledge
Fuck what they be talkin' bout, fuck what they allege
I know them bitches gon' hate on my Giuseppe wedge (check)
Box spring cost 25k bitch
I'm out in Cali, fuckin' wit' the black K-fed
And nah man, I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest
Playtime been over fuck a recess
Playtime been over fuck a seesaw
Bitches wanna play a game  Go and see Saw
That's one, that's two, and that's three four
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off 
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid
I mean look, your bitch came off an island
I came in the game '09 wilin'
I'm out in Hollywood, left off Highland
These bitches loud, but when the Queen come  (silent...)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter, he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like  Chomping on a chicken dinner 
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle 
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) No muzzle
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees (Ackees)
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky (Cocky)
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky (Rocky)
I am Nicki (Nicki), Minaj or Lewinski (Lewinski)
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed (6-speed)
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard

Go hard

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunovich"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, "What you doin', Nicki " Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B 
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Want another round  Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1]
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, "Which world tour should I go on today "
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say 
What the fuck they gon' say 
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say 
What the fuck they gon' say 
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Bridge]
It's okay, it's okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say  (What they gon' say )
What the fuck they gon' say  (What they gon' say )
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

That they could play with my clit
Oooh, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, lotta boobs
Man, I make the baddest bitches send me nudes

Gettin' head in the carpool

I'm tryna smash, I got the cash, she got the ass
Now tell your friends I'm a lil nigga wit a big one, ain't tryna brag
I'm Eli in that strip club, that money, got a quarter back
I make a hike, go long, first down, that's 10 racks
She said I can't fuck for free
I told her that's cool by me

It's king of diamonds so starless onyx, my whore got bitter
'Cause I ain't come home this morning, she almost torched my shit
When I hit a shopping spree oh shit I ball
Sorry but you can't get these at Lenox mall

I just heard that I was the baddest in the town
So I came down and had to pick up my crown
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans
Call Wyclef, I'm a need a couple Haitians

Please stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar 
Give 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur

No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the 45 special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry

Move like you really wanna be number one
You can, you can, you can beat out the comp
Run like you really wanna be at the top

Topic of discussion, but beat it like a percussioner
And chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love

Who the hell is this 
Calling me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying 

[Kandi]
Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project 

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

[Kandi]
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

[Nicki Minaj]
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

[Kandi]
They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

[Nicki Minaj]
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean 
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming[Intro]
Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show 
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power 
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Outro]
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

She said "fuck Fendi" but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right 
And what's her nationality  She Chinese, right 
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj  She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
(Nothing I do is good enough for you)

[Verse 2]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
  Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile (Still I might)
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi (I'mma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh)
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi (tell 'em hi from me)
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce (when we reminisce, reminisce, baby)
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music bizNow every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, "wetter than jacuzzi bitches"

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

[Verse 2]
Half a bar,  just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 1]
Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real 
Or are you plotting to kill 
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that 
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back

[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 2]
Every time I try to fuck with you
Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds
I could be fucking with them other niggas
And no you ain't them other niggas
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches
Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it
You keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy
If she could cut her wrist off
I ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie
Like it was just his fault
But I know if a nigga lose me
Then nigga, ooh-wee, that's his loss, young nigga

[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Intro (Spoken): Nicki Minaj]
I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That's-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
You bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof, flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they say I'm a Star Spangle
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then reindeer in the winter (in the winter)

[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
So I got a bad-bitch mentality
'Cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out
'Cause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy

[Chorus]
I get crazy

[Outro (Spoken): Nicki Minaj]
When I do it, it get did-ed, I was fixing my fitted
Pull up in a 6 Series, she was fixing your Civic
When I do it, it gets done, 2 sticks in my bun
Pull up in a 6, hun, you was fixing to run, hoe
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(You know, you know my name is Nicki Minaj, trick)
(Let's get it)
I get crazy, I get crazy
I get motherfuckin', motherfuckin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, that's what my name is
My name means crazy in cr-crazy language[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me 
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Chorus]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Post-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am 
To have and to hold 'til death do us part 
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start 
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Bridge]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)

[Outro]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am[Verse]

Man, they been rocking with me since the beginning, inning
This is where the stress ends
Feel ill, when you never gotta stress ends
Always in the press when
Paparazzi in the bushes, with the stretch lens
Say cheese to that, pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them
No, them strippers ain't mad, when I touch on them
Russell Simmons shoe game, put a rush on them
Send a GT vodka, sitting on top of
Mafia money, eating seafood pasta

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
But, you're boring as fuck though, why these bitches in the game so cutthroat 
Why they can't just let Young Nicki live  Why they gotta feel the wrath, to know Nicki is -
Not playing  Boss for real, when they go against The Kid, it's gon' cost for-real (Pharrell)
Came straight from the hood, with the cross appeal
That's why these big names, wanna toss the deal
Okay, I'll take it, sign on the dotted line, but I'm quick to check a bitch if she outta line
Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel, why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol, huh 
Say cheese to that, when they see me on the screen, check E! for that
Bitches lying on the kid, I won't leave for that, intimidated by my aura, where Rita at 
Send a GT vodka, in a helicopter, me and my Japanese bitches

True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston

[Verse 1]
I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy 
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheating liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

[Chorus]
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Verse 2]
I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheating liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

And you are puttin' on and you're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd 
If you are, then baby, take me now

[Chorus]
Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good (Oh, I didn't know)
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner[Verse 1]
You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so, I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you re reaching out for me, you ll see you reap everything you sow

[Verse 2]
You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that you're blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you re reaching out for me, you ll see you reap everything you sow

And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Raah, I eat your face off
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake-off
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball
(Skrr) I'll beat your brakes off
Hi, I'm Tune, salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch, pardon the goons
Throw dirt on the floor, get caught in the broom
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got money and the power, a woman in the shower
And she don't want nothing but my Johnson, Howard
Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet, sweet and sour
You're scared  Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Ah, I don't know what y'all on
Please, I go in like "Goin'"
Drink in my hand with the world in the other
The Uzi go "Brrrr". stutter
Life is a puzzle, jigsaw
All I do is win, my name should be "Victor" (Haha)
Old-ass rappers
I'm still the shit, old-ass Pampers
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin'
I was just dumpin my ashes, I'ma puff it and pass it
I'm a fuckin' assassin, you should jump in the casket

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on 
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone 
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot 
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me  Overnight 
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's

Wash your mouth out with soap, boys[Chorus: The Big Pink & Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Uh-huh)
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, ayo, ayo)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every muhfuckin' city (Kyuh)

[Chorus: The Big Pink, Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, yo)
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, so when I'm in the hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strang 
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyonc 

[Chorus: The Big Pink]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes

In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, (Rambo!), Liberace (tango!)
Swingin on the vine, mango (Mango )

Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the  burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend 
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me 
You know you re Harry and I ll always be Hermione

[Chorus]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I m sending ain't making it through to your heart

[Verse 2]
Dear Wayne, I'm writing another letter 'cause
You never did respond, it's been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope 
I woulda climbed up, but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors 
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heaven's doors
Let's play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game 
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
 Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner 
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
(If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger)

[Chorus]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

[Outro]
I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
Said I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm wait-eh-eh-eh-eh-ay[Verse 1]
I used to think that we d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever
I ll be over here, you ll be over there
I ma shed a tear, but I really don t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever

[Verse 2]
I used to think that we d reunite
I d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever
I ll be over here, you ll be over there
I ma shed a tear, but I really don t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever

[Bridge]
This is my last cry
Is this the only way 
This is my own prison
I m frozen in time, in time, in time

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever
I ll be over here, you ll be over there
I ma shed a tear, but I really don t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you ll be young forever

[Outro]
You ll always be mine (yeah, baby)
Frozen in time
Young forever (young forever)[Pre-Chorus]

Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape (Oh)
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation
Top five tax bracket in the population
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why
I ain't gotta wonder if I want to lease or buy
And I dictate how I'm gon' piece the pie
I ain't talkin' about no mothafuckin' pizza pie
'Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans
Nah, homie, you gon' need a bigger cock-pit
'Cause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit

Ayo, Captain, ayo, Cap

[Verse 2]
I'm in the UK, but just for one day
Who's to say I won't come back again 
Materialistic, I'm narcissistic
My shoe game is mean, it's so sadistic
I took the Learjet to cop some lipstick
Yeah, I'ma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Ros , you sip your Mystic
My flow's a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators
Balenciagas and they gotta be the Gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson
I'm on the bike, doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin'
Gucci bag, just to put the coke cans in

[Break]
Hey, yo, Anna, hey, yo, Anna Wintour
I'ma need that cover, baby girl
It's Pink Friday, ya dig

You be yellin' boom-boom when you really pum-pum
See, my flow hotter than noon in June, June
If Biggie was alive, he'd sign me
I'm the New Edition, like Bobby and Ronnie
Just give me the beat and a bottle of Dasani
And I don't need Clyde, I'm a boss; fuck a Bonnie, ya dig 
Religious like the preachers, I came to warn you
Listen bitches, I'm the teacher, go sit in the corner
How many times I gotta spit 'til they know that I'm the bitch 
I'm flyer than a maggot, I'm on some shit
First they love you, then they switch
Yeah, they switch like faggots
That is why I keep the llamas in Gabanna's fabrics (I'm the shit)
Should be in Pampers, like Markie Biz's
Give anybody the business, like her's and his'es
Cause my flow tighter than them virgin bitches
You know them asalamalakum, them Persian bitches 
And if you miss me, I'm swervin' sixes
Goddamn, ain't even pregnant, but I'm birthin' bitches
Cause I got flavor, like that girl Deelishis
Stop actin' like you a killer, with all them girly disses, bitches
I ain't Johnny, but my, my, my-y-y
She want it with me, tell her affi bloodclaat try-y-y
You ain't thorough, I'm the truth, you a li-i-ie
My whole borough yellin' out boom, bye by-y-ye
Cause when I seen her, she was shakin' in her boots (Word )
When Nicki came through, she was throwin' up the deuce
Slapped her, then I asked her what's my name, she said N-I-C
The President of the NYC, you dead wrong[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, baby
Even though you break my heart
I still love you

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight 
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo
That bitch is always flippin'
You niggas never listen
We make a perfect team
Balling Jordan and Scottie Pippen
But I'ma let you dip in
That wax sauce drippin'
Said that when you with a boss bitch, now you can tell the difference
You be like jungle digger
I don't want another nigga
I wanna make you 'bout a legend, but I make you bigger
Tinkerbell, Peter Pan
No bitches badder than me when I pull up
Got 'em screaming like a temper tan'
Ayo, DJ, drop the beat
My gun didn't fall but I drop the heat
I love how we kept it on the low, mad discreet (I'm in a rush!)
Pass me the keys to my jeep (truck)
I hit 'em with it, I'ma kill 'em with that wine wine
Ain't losin' watches, but with me, he always find time
We keep it classy when we eatin' it's that fine dine
But between love and hate, baby, it's a fine line

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight 
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 2: Nas]
A mack
I used to mack with the MAC on me
Project parties, lights off, mad horny
Dutty wine and feel the gun I'm hidin'
She still grindin' on me, smilin' at me
I'm like "Hi, I'm Nasty"
"God bless ya, met ya'"
Thought you were sexy as ever
Flexing with your ex, I couldn't disrespect ya'
Later on, I undress ya, couldn't wait to sex ya'
Made a nigga wait so long, but it was special
Light travel faster than sound
Lightning strike one second every point two miles
So when you first saw me emerge from a weed cloud
Electricity touch your soul, that's how I get down
Gangsta love
Completing each other
Touching tongues so close, we could breathe for each other
Untouchable boy with the illustrious girl
But maybe being together's too much for the world, sorry

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight 
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas[Intro]
If you move, I'll fall
(Davaughn on the beat)
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby

[Verse]
I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
"I love Nicki" scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah, follow the rules)
(Let me say my prayers and get ready for school)
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it)
(Please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

[Outro]
Ay! Can anybody hear me 
Ay! Can anybody hear me 
Ay! Can anybody hear me 
Ay! Can anybody hear me [Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic

[Verse 1]
It's automatic, I'm a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you bizarre tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic, my condition's unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Verse 2]
It's automatic, some might call it insane
I assure you, I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be falling for me, boy
Yeah, just like a domino tonight tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically, I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am

Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile
It must hurt to sell your album off PayPal
'Specially when you in the game 15, 20
You was hot when Shaq teamed up with Penny
Man, you was magic!
I mean, look at you now, ho, you just tragic!
You a tragedy, you a parody
Last name Ann, first name Raaaaaaggggedy
These goofy bitches is stupidity personified
Ayo, Wayne, you want it gully, or the Gaza side[Intro: Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid-ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill, right 
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
Uh, you could bring it any day
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang-bang the pistol

Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

Running through there and I put on the stars (I'm ready to shoot)
Oh, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now, yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one, yeah

Fitted down and I'm ready to play
When ya album gonna drop, bitches never could say
Say, "Fuck I look like giving birds they props 
Bitches act like they hot, but I heard they not"
How the fuck you in the game like ten years strong
You bitches still can't write ya own damn songs
You see me on the stoop man these birds just salute me
Whether I'm in the coupe or the hoopti, Duke see
I'm always with a dude, that'll off the kufi
Let him eat my coochie and cop me Pucci
House in the boonies, rock a doobie
Cock the 22, then spark a loosey
He tell me I'm the one, he probably right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
Your girl get it poppin' like dynamite
Dynamite, the coke albino white
Name one bitch in the game, that I can't murder
Chicken noodle bitches, on the side with a soda
Give it to everybody, like a cop with a quota
Stop playing poker hop in something mocha
I eat bitches, no knife, no fork-a (or)
Bitch want it with me  Living the life lo-ca
Oh, I get it you a joker
Leave a dot on your head, and I ain't talking bout polka
You the type, that be runnin' ya mouth
See you on the block, wanna run in ya house
I'm with that nigga Fendi, never fucks with a slouch
I fuck with dirty money, like what's under the couch
Cause ain't a bitch could fuck with my flow
When it comes to drugs, mami just say no
Either you're on something or you're S-L-O
Had to switch up the flow, let this skeptos (sketels) know
I come, cum hard, I don't come with garbage
Just one phone call, they gon' come regardless
I always got the ball ma, I don't roll with starters
Write my own bars and my flow's the hardest, nigga[Intro]
As I sit back relax crack jokes for a minute
I think about the up-and-comers that could probably get it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I might go to jail for fuckin with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Maino life is like a movie
Set up the cameras, fuck him in the jacuzzi
Freekey Zeke, that should be easy
He just came home, I know he wanna bone
But what about JR Writer, I'mma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'mma grill him
The nigga Pap, he might, could fuck me
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' a Gino Green
Tell Stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some d's on it & im might breathe on it
And when Im Philly I gotta Fuck Gillie
Snatch his big max & slap a bitch silly

You know them fat niggas love to eat
And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
"Nicki what about Fendi  He made you pop"
Tell him to kick rocks, or give me some top
I'm on my way to Jer', to break Ransom off
Quench his thirst, when my pants come off

Scoop whoever win and, tell him to sca-dattle
Run up on Mims, he could give me backshots

All the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
I body bitches, I don't need a burner

Little white tee, plus some tight jeans

Wrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin' money, like it grow on trees
Stay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps
After I'm done, then you will acknowledge
I'm the president, never went to college
I'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin' 
Got the illest dude in the game, speakin my name

Same number they stiched on McGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it, will you reimburse me

When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me 
Why, when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me 
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly 
Why did you fear that  Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she 
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go "Ding!"

High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at )
She balls, he calls (where my money at )
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at )
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at )
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at )
She balls, he calls (where my money at )

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
But when a good girl gone, she gone forever
See, you can't make it rain without the stormy weather
And it's funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
Would've never happened if I would've stayed indoors
Would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
Cause now I'm hot but the critics say I'm just looks
They say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out
Cause when I come out niggas get their umbrellas out
I take the L 'cause I don't want to see my brother lose
Been through it all but I can never fill my mother's shoes
And now, I don't want a handout
I just want my ad-libs to get panned out
And I just wanna tell the girls that could feel me
That I just play the cards that a nigga deal me
See, everything I been through coulda killed me
That's why there really ain't nothing you could tell me
You see, I live for the bill, I die for the bill
And I still make sure I read the bi  to the  ble
And every time I write I'm precise in my skill
It's more to life than just ice in your grill
Fuck me, blame me, fuck you, pay me
This is what you made me (where my money at )
Say you want to drape me, turned around and rape me
Now you ain't mistake me (where my money at )

Famous like a drug that I've taken too much of

Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes (hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you look like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed

But I collect a 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team
Young Money till the death of me

Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the, oh-now-that's-just-ridiculous!
We could've cleared up all these particulars
That could have been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin', up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed, when you got that phone call
That's the effect they call a snow ball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' "Please come back, I have given my all!"
I have given my all
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all, catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me)

[Verse 2]
You wanted oh so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waitin', 'cause I am in need, of more attention
Could've called back, just to say somethin'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doing well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately, to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all, catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me)

Okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
It's, it's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
It's whatever you say, ayy, ayy

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  (Catch me)
Could you catch me  I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me)[Hook]

You're too wack, to get up on one of my songs (Whoop!)
You got a deal, cause you was givin' up the coochie, prolly (Uhn!)
But I'll arrange one hit, like "Oochie Wally" (Uhn!)

Town, ask Yung Joc, "It's Goin' Down" (Yes!)
Kisses to my bitches, and my niggas, get a pound

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho - punt!
Forced trauma - blunt
You play the back, bitch I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]
Nicki!!! How you gon' take my hot line and make it a hot song
Like I ain't 'posed to come and step on this shit like King Kong!!!
See as a child I was born with a old soul
See I would breathe heavy flame would shoot out of my nose hole
HAAAAAAAA RRRAAHHHHHH!!! Too much shitty diapers
Love to play with matches and drink all the fluid out of lighters
From when I was a child I know that most of y'all was triddash
I dig in my nose and wipe the biggest BOOGER on your bitch asssssss!!!!
Using your head like fuck what the Lord said
Slightly demented with a permanent wrinkle in my forehead
Boar's Head beef bitch if you want it then peep lane
Murder niggas with the fire then bounce to a Heat game
Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain
And I'll comfortably hang you from the side of the building
So niggas see your bitch ass is LAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEE!!!!
"Aiyyo what you cut it off for  Don't you see what I'm doin to this !"
'Posed to know how I'm directing these flicks
The question everywhere is "you getting on the remix " (DAMN RIGHT!!!)
Cause this is something that I fathered and mastered
And plastered 'til they started calling me sick bastard
I'm drastic when it comes to reminding niggas who's responsible for the classics
And I burn a hole in the street like a nigga was acid
Everytime I jump on the beat see the shit will get drastic
While you getting yo' ass kicked
Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops
Kinda like pong ping baduf baf beat him until he diggity 2Pac
Mi broke mi ting leave a few match
Rope him and then drag him a few blocks (HORRIBLE)
Uh! Uh! Uh! The muscle of the street (MOVE BITCH)
Pardon me UH! Shuffling the beat nigga!!!
UH! Take a elbow, I'm scuffling to eat
Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks
So I rushed and rushed, then I blacked
Then I came through and I gave the streets crack
Controlling the functions throughout the steer
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING HANDS IN THE AIR!!! (That's how I do 'em)
I do the type of shit that niggas can't imagine (Uh Huh!)
You know I'm one of the nicest and I ain't bragging (Uh Huh!)
I make 'em all surrender 'til they see white flags
And they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon (OK!)
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your shitty drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this and I'll twist you to a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old stale urine
GONE!!!!

Tossed, tossed t-tossed
Tossed, tossed t-tossed
All my bad bitches that's tryna get tossed, let's get it c'mon

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross]
Shawty straight diggin' me like I'm his main chick
I know you bitches on the sideline like "ain't that a bitch"
I'm on my job, ain't lookin' for head knock
Cause it's just another day and I like gettin' my salad tossed
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far (Ross!)
Got the biggest cars, Spanish broads, no bra[Charlamagne]
Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about New York City. I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say "What do you mean  She shouts it out all of the time."

[Nicki Minaj]
Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

[Charlamagne]
She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York 

[Nicki Minaj]
Hell fucking no.

[Charlamagne]
And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

[Nicki Minaj]
I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

Well, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, "Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next." You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

[Charlemange]
What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy 

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value 

[Nicki Minaj]
Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

[Nicki Minaj]
Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
They're gonna say, "You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle."

[Nicki Minaj]
"Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki "

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
"Why don't you stand up "

[Charlemange]
That happens to everybody, though.

[Nicki Minaj]
It does.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.

Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, "I did look like a damn fool "

[Nicki Minaj]
Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

[Charlemagne]
Do you ever think that 

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars  I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, "Damn, she looks like a fool," but you're a superstar.

That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________

[Nicki Minaj]
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.

I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that 

[Charlemagne]
You can! Why not 

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space 

[Nicki Minaj]
They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.

[Charlemagne]
Who do you feel that you lean towards more 

[Nicki Minaj]
I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.

That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.

When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

[Charlemagne]
It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

[Nicki Minaj]
Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.

It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15   still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

[Charlemagne]
I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

[Nicki Minaj]
And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, "Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen." Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning 

[Charlemagne]
She's winning!

[Nicki Minaj]
So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning  Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap  The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit  Get the fuck out of here!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids  Get married 

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
"Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time..."

[Nicki Minaj]
Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you have any regrets  Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj 

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

[Charlemange]
How can the author of "I wish I could enjoy this moment for life" not be here trying to enjoy every moment 

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Pause!

[Nicki Minaj]
And then all of a sudden it's like, "Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it 

[Charlemagne]
Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.

[Nicki Minaj]
And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, "No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place." It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, "Are you sure you're ok " But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
What is Nicki Minaj's purpose  Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.

Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, "She's obviously here for something." I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose 

[Nicki Minaj]
I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, "We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.

But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like "They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time." How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.

I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.

It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, "Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school," or "I got my GED, I'm good." And I don't want my fans to think like that.

I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, "Look, Nicki, Look." Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.

One day, you're going to look back and think "Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children "

We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control 

Why are we stuck with a baby  Why are we always stuck on the welfare line  Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children  Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby  Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children 

Technology has changed   you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like "I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes." That's my bigger goal in life.

[Charlemagne]
How do you stay humble  I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy  Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra... 

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
You wanna know what's crazy  Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, "It's so crazy. She's so famous." If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.

The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.

She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, "I'm this person" or, "I'm that person." She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass 

[Nicki Minaj]
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

[Safaree "SB" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that 

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.

People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.

It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, "What  They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs  Why don't they fucking appreciate their success  I would kill to be where they are," until you get here and you are like, "Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this " And he's like, "Yep. Now let's see who really want it." But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. "I'm tired of being humble."

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm not a cocky person by nature.

[Charlemagne]
Scaff, be cocky for her!

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

[Nicki Minaj]
What!  What would need to be sucked  On you 

[Scaff "SB" Beezy]
Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, "Damn, hip hop can take you this far! " I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

[Nicki Minaj]
Thank you, darling.

Charlemange da God, singed out![Intro]
You know, it just dawned on me

My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

And if you not talking money then I don t understand your language

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
It's going down, down Barbie, pushing a pink Ferrari
I race through Africa just to see the safari
I am the baddest bitch in America
Slicker than a Jheri curl, just ask Erykah
The black Sarah Jessica, J-J-Jessica!
Don't be text messaging me, I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese, lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on the stage I'm with SB
And when you see my luggage it says LV
And when I'm on the plane it's so empty
Hmmm, that's why all those female rappers envy

[Hook/Outro (Spoken)]
Oh, I'm sorry. Did she say something  My bad
You know, maybe I was booked. I guess I missed ya
You know, when you're booked four times a week every week, it's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Oh, you do the math
It's barbie, bitch![Intro]
Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

[Verse 1]
It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22 
Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches whatchu know 'bout me, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

[Verse 2]
Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf-clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan 
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know' bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Hello world!
Young moolah baby!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj (Lil Wayne)]
Murda dem, murda dem! (Yeah!)
Just one word, body a third of them (Nicki)
I kick kick game, can't injure Nicki (Minaj)
That's why they nick-nicknamed me, Ninja Nicki (Lewinsky!)
I'm such a yes, and you're a no no
Live with a Dragon, and wear a kimono
I'm from the Philippines, badder than Billy Jean
Guess that is why I get more head, than an a guillotine
But then I'm dumb struck 'cause you bums suck
Where the um---where the fuck is my nunchuck 
I'm in Tokyo, with the Cokio
Somebody sleepin' in my bed like Nokio
I'm gettin' ill, I been poppin' a pill again
I'm on an Island, and I'm lookin' for Gilligan
Where my Timberland  I got 'em tremblin'
Can't find my keys, but I know, I hear them jingling
You're such a Marilyn   Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing 
You at the door  Ok, I'm about to come down
I'm getting numb now, don't let me come down

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Lil Wayne)]
Sniffing on some good blow (Nicki Minaj!)
It's like I'm sippin' on the tempo
And I can't come down now (It's the president y'all and that's the mistress)
Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Young Moola, baby! (Yeaaah!)
I do what I does
I come through this bitch, wrist bluer, than 'cuz'
I'm so five star, Soo Woo to the bloods
And before I had a mirror, I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin', I knew where I was
Yeah, d-d-d-dirty, dirty south, see my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust  Who can you love 
When love kills, like somebody gave Cupid a gun 
It go (BAW!) Like you shooting for fun
And sometimes the solution is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one  
A.M. and the conclusion, is you losing a son
No inducing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds, I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh   fat, and just like it, you can get lit
Shit don't stank, when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand, I'ma hit her like Hank
Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think
Weezy

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Lil Wayne)]
Sniffing on some good blow (Young Money)
It's like I'm sippin' on the tempo (Dirty Money)
And I can't come down now (Cash Money)
Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite (Young Moola, baby)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, It's the President man and the Mistress, Ms. Nicki Minaj aka. Nicki Lewinsky, yea and I am the president, shut yo mouth![Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good

[Verse 1]
I tell them bitches anyway
'Cause we don t care what none of them gyal affi say
You can t stop me, I ma fulfill my prophecy
I do it, I did it, the proper way
Ah, my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The V.I.P lights is hitting us just right
So if you getting money, just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer
'Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes, I m life-size
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie 
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good (Yo)

[Verse 2]
Okay, now, this right here can get me in trouble
'Cause when I say I ball, I don t mean in a huddle
I m always in the lime, I never do nothing subtle
'Cause it s Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal
My two guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I m at the game, I m in the best row
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
'Cause I, I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes here mean fashionista
 Cause these don t come out 'til it's Easter
I m V.I.P bound with Leighton Meester

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good

Cause, ooh, he so gutter, he m-m-make me stutter
The French Vanilla truck's inside peanut butter
The girls wanna see him, the boys wanna be him
Get payed like per diem from the a.m. to the p.m

Somebody go tell him I get wetter than tilapias
And I am bi-populars, oops, I mean bipolar

I mean, I was in the SL, ice on the bezel
I ain't mad at you lil' mama, you a sketel
I'm a winner, you that thing that start with a "S.L."
Rhyme with a cruiser, end with a r-ra
Yup, you're a loser, I am a super star-ah
F.A.B.O., I do it, like Toccara
Cause ya'll some dylon hoes
Tryna fuck up my band, I fuck with Nylon holes
I got the pumps and the bumps,the pumps in the trunk
In case I gotta spazz, and blast you mudda cunt
I had to laugh at that one
Bitch get outta line, I'mma slap the fat one
I'm such a maniac
Where Wayne at  I'm tryna get some, brainiac
I gets down, like when niggas is shootin'
Mami, I style wild, like when niggas is lootin'
Hoes is mad, cause these hoes is losin'
They do a lot of walkin', I do alot of cruisin'
Put the top in the back of trunk
Take off a shoe, slap a bitch with the back of the pump
I ain't never had a problem giving bitches the business
Pop bitches in the eye, like I finished my spinach
I'm a New York broad, spend chips in the village
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jaguar
Girls don't like me, guess it's the swagger
Don't talk to me 'bout, chicks got skills
She's alright, but she's not real
Listen big homie, I'm that deal
I say I body bitches, mean that bitch got killed
Riding the baseline, like I'm 'Quil O'Neal

[Hook] (x2)
Now how many bitches do it take to knock me down
You know bitches gon' hate
But I don't give a fuck who you bodied on tape
I'm into movin' weight mami in and out of state
Let's get it now[Intro:]
I don't wanna sound mad, though! I don't wanna sound mad!
I feel marvelous right now!
Dirty money!

[Verse:]
Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She won 3 rounds, I'mma need a hundred thou
Like china town, bitches better bow down
Oh, you ain't know  bet ya'll bitches know now
Fuck I gotta do to let 'em know that I'm the one 
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the 6 hun the color of bubble gum
I'm with my nigga spits and my nigga, bun crum (waddup!)
Yes, I'm the one, I'm the motherfuckin' one (chyeah!)
Hold more weight than the late big pun (oh!)
Bitches talk slick, but they ain't say nun (no!)
Mad cause I'm bad, 2 sticks in my bun (chyeah!)
Yes, sir, look what i've done
They r-run, run when I come
Bum-stickity-bum, let me tell 'em where I'm from
Queens, little mama, gabbana, some nice pumps (chyeah!)[Intro]
Thank you
Thank you for comin' out tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for )
New York City

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Nick'  Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn,  but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill 
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go "Ew" 
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills 
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal 
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

[Hook]
Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to  roar
(What the hell are you waiting for )
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for )

[Verse 2]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night 
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind 
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it 
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

[Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Nicki Minaj]
Can I get an encore
I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar[Verse 1]
Hear the Devil callin', I can hear 'em
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you."
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply
Yellin' "Rasta, alright! " when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding!

[Hook](x2)
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'

Get down, get down, get down down
Get d- get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down on the ground
Get down, get down on the ground

[Verse 2]
Man, fuck a P0, and fuck a C0
'Bout to "Set It Off", like Cleo
Mad, they done tapped my Treo
Bagged my skio, heard the bitch lyin' like Leo
Anyway, I'm the ninja, Kawasaki blazin'
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin'
The young Chaka Khan, yes - "I Am Every Woman"
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

[Hook]

[Outro]
Can you hear the yellin' 
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me[Hook]
I done put sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm DMC like run
Listen mammi I'm the muhfuckin one

You don't like me you just like my flow
Just booked a show but I might not go
Nigga said he didn't have a pole for my ho
Damn why a nigga tryna fuck up my dough 

When it come to me every light say go
They tell me to stop but I'm like hell no
Now everybody watch my M.O
Nicki been hot since you rock shell tops
Yessir

Ha ha ha ha
Gotta laugh at that
Bitch give me the ball I'm a pass it back

[Hook] x2

You can spot me from a mile away
Nicki sexy any time of day
Word on the street is that I'm chinese
No lil mama I'm just high off haze

Don't fuck a dude if a dude don't pay
Don't suck a dude if a dude dirty
When it come to you gotta look purty
Sit up in the booth get your weave curly, hey

Sim simma
Pass me the keys to my beemer
Wish I had a booty like Trina
Nigga get your green up

Got me a new body, now I need some new dick
I ain't bust shots, don't duck, unless the shoe fits
Cookie can't make me the GOAT, cookie can't come with the throat
Puff, puff, pass, no, you do not want the smoke
B-b-bitches be sleeping on me but be claiming they woke (ooh)
Fuck up a check on my body (ahaha)
Then let them lick on my body out in Abu Dhabi (Grr)
You see me shining, you pissed
I-I-I think my haters just really be wanting a kiss (mwah)
They know I'd body you, sis
Old n***a hit me and I said "New body, who this " (ooh)
(Old n***a hit me and I said "New body, who this )[Verse]
You know they say Nicki spit crazy, get it poppin' -

Young Money First Lady,ya know, baby girl  -
Of the group, I'm also known as baby girl, in the coupe
Never get me confused, as Baby girl in the hoop
Cause, Nicki stay fly, like that Cash Money dude
I'm stuntin' on these hoes, like Marilyn Monroe
I got a S curl flow, I spit slick, ya know 
And I don't just spit raps, and chit chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Ya girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But, Nicki rather chill, and stack a mil'
While these hoes, stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on tha track, like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like, 'Quille O'Neal
Gassed ya baby father, for the keys to the Escalade
Not a baby momma, but I'm drama like, Kay Slate
What can I say  That's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down, to tha cuticles
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves
Nicki stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines
Lemme remind you, I'm gettin' a tan too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from Queens
They say I'm too pretty, to be spittin' sixteens
I should be on the screen, posin' for Maybelline
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll
Pardon me, if the cockiness, botherin' y'all
I'm just bein' Nicki Minaj, ya know 
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J
Ma' you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out
Doin' this since, you was Reebok, Classic Doubt
Now this ho, wanna get at Nic', why 
Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nic' so gutter, lil' white tee, need some Air Max on
Some Dolce and Gabbana, pretty panties on
Like, wait 'til the summer catch me, up in the hummer
On my way to 555 front, run with the Rucker
And every baller wanna never, give out my number
Only that email, Cherry-thong.com, -
Holla! Name a girl, as real as her
No, not them! Who's your best emcee 
Nic, Fox, and Kim, can't forget Rem'
Nic' up in the Porsche Box, or the BenzOkay
How you gon' tell me I'm not the best
That came out the West  Um, I mean the East, see
I'm the president, but I don't live in D.C
I rep the NY, FYI, I said I rep the NY, FYI
I get them pies to them guys that say, " ay, ay, ay!"
I'm the head honcho, get work from papi
And dead Pancho, put him in the roncho
I mean Range Rov' where we let them things go
I only fuck with dudes that could let their chain show
(Get your chain out, nigga!), I'm such a eighty's babe
Think you can beat me, then you're azy-cray
Body bitches, have them pushing up aisies-day
Won't you be my DJ, like Lazy K  (He on the 1's and 2's, bitch)
I'm such a psycho, niggas call me Michael
Nicki been hot, since you was on your tricycle
Bitches, Romans, countrymen
You salute the president with your country friend
Bitch, you ain't writing shit, you get ten percent (What up )
And you softer than them dudes, with their wrist-es bent
(Ah-a-a-a-a-ha!) It's Nickelodeon
I am the president, where my podium 
And why these girls salty  Why they sodium  (I don't know)
Is it because my flow slicker than petroleum 
See, I'm that yellow bus girl
They say "Nicki, you the best!", and I tell them "Uh, dur!"
You tell me what I know, I guess I must concur
I'm the reason why these bitches yelling, "Fuck her!" (Yes Sir!)
'Cause everybody hate when you're great and you're caking
And when I say caking, I ain't talking 'bout baking (Oh , okay)
But they gon' get it all wrong
Fucking with them fake thugs and them fake Don Juans
Say he got workers like the kids in Hong Kong (Stop lying!)
But he ain't getting chips unless you count them Bon Tons (Oh shit!)
Tell that nigga womp womp
Cause you ain't getting chips unless you count then Bon Tons

[Spoken]
How the only chips you got is Bon Ton potato chips 
Like, that's what I don't understand, I try to tell these niggas, like, you can't be serious
I'm Nicki Minaj!
Other than that, like, if you can't see I'm the best
I mean really, you know, these bitches so washed up
I'm walking around with them dryer sheets
Like, you know, the sheets you throw in the dryer
Yeah, I'm walking around with them sheets now
Cause, like, when I see these washed up ass bitches
I'm just throwing them on bitches like, real talk, like

Bitch, hit the dryer, you washed!
Dirty Money[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ok ok ok ok, now who's hot, who's not 
Shorty doo whoop, it's cool you bloodclot (cool)
You come to the spot, see if you don't get got
See if you don't get got, when the semi go cock
I'm like "Aye, what the fuck a bitch think "
Nick, you know ain't nothing changed, but my wink
Pink on pink, everything in-sync
I write pretty lyrics, every pen pink ink
I'm representin' all my girls, niggas double up
I don't play around, I'm a have to shut her down
Run up into town, I'm a have to get the crown
I'm the Young Queens bitch, with the platinum sound
None of ya girls can steal my shine, Fendi -
Schooled me to the game, now I'm in my prime
Stay humble, stay low, stay on the grind
I don't need a light, but I stay in the lime

[Hook]
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
Damn, Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
(Damn) Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Guess what Nicki spit crack, like yayo
Yep, matter fact, when I rap, It's a K.O
Come through the hood, all the boys say "Ayo!"
Lettuce and tomato, don't forget the mayo
Words in the street, that Nicki don't play doe
Bitches pop shit, but they soft like play dough
Gotta lotta banks, so she wanna be me
I gotta full tank, little momma on E
I fly first class overseas, on this BB
Snapple in my hand and it's strawberry kiwi
I ain't even make it, and these girls wanna be me
You "Mrs. Me Too", like you always say me me
I'm who they believe in, mommy don't even
Soon as I put the keys in, I switch like seasons
Get a couple beats from my nigga Doe Beezy
Why would I go hard, when this shit is so easy

[Hook x2]Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj on December 8, 1982. Ever since she was little, Nicki has continuously made up alter egos that serve a variety of purposes.
In the beginning, Nicki's alter egos offered her an escape from reality but they eventually evolved into a means of representing herself in the music industry, helping her get her point across and add more variety to her music.

Baby boy, you must got Nicki twisted
I would've left before, but you insisted
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core, I gotta leave you
How could you love me, and humiliate me 
You ain't my man, don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me
A lil' bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days, from
The slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money, it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say
At night, I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
'Cause when they said it, I said "Creep on who "
No, not my boo, ain't what he gon' do

[Chorus]
Oh, now you wanna be with me, but you can't be with me
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life, you shoulda treated me right
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

[Verse 2]
Why you saying you ain't feel her 
You was in the villa, she was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin' on a Miller
My bitch Pam' had the hidden cam, like Killa
Funny how you win some, you lose some
Never worry where your income would come from
'Cause no matter where you was, I held you down
Up north to uptown, so how you sound 
Now you all up in my face, 'bout you make mistakes
If I'd have known you was fake, I'd have laced your steak
Strychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape (wine)
Quit lying, why you lying  I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room, give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned
Just like Usher, nigga, you gon' have to let it burn
To the left, and I ain't talkin' about Jigga girl

[Chorus]
Oh, now you wanna be with me, but you can't be with me
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life, you shoulda treated me right
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha goJust when they thought I was done for the summer
Came out the cupboard, show my ass like a plumber
I ain't Chinese, but you're worth two dolla'
Tee get the bleach, I'm a show my true ca-la
Tell a nigga holla in the peach Impala
Only if he give good brain like a scholar
A-la, a-la, a-la eyy!
Knock your top off like a holiday
Dang, little mama, I should be in your pot
Cause everywhere I go they saying Nicki you're hot
I catch more eyes than the letter with the dot
Super-size fries, my pies better be hot
She got it twisted like a cock-eyed bitch
That's why I be in Mr.Chows, you a Popeye's bitch
You the type to get some money, go spend it on some boots
Save just enough for some douche for your cooch'
It ain't about money, you ain't speakin' my lang'
Cuttin' any bitch off if she enter my lane
And it really ain't a thang, when I bang, I bang
And my goons swing by like orangutans
Fuck wrong with you  I am the Don-dada
I show you how to do it, like I'm your mo-mother
You can't beat me, so don't do-don't bother
You soft like butter,and no, I don't stutter
You Romeo and I'm Master P
That's why they mention me first, then you after me (Next!)
I'm the up and comin' that the streets talk about
The twenty-two slugga, make a bitch walk it out
(Now walk it out!)
Nicki get it poppin' like I came unannounced
Stay with a goon and my goon dumbin' out
So, first thing first, I'm the queen of the crew
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do 
I could cook crack, or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do 
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew

[Outro]
I am the president, I am the president
Dirty Money
Queens, New York is in the motherfuckin' building, building, building
Building, building, building, building, building, haha
You gotta love me, mayne
Gravy what up  Get your fat ass in the booth, nigga[Talkin: Nicki Minaj]
Chea, Nicki Minaj
Dirty Money, Young Money
Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and... 
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky
Look (fucker!)

[Verse: 1]
When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
"Nick-Nack, Carry Crack", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

[Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

[Verse: 2]
Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this: "I'm not impressed, bitch"
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars
(You shouldn't have said that) NY to NO
Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
See, see, you see Anna Mae 
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like
Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like
So, anything you talk about, like, it gotta be, it gotta be, at least, within a two-year radius type shit, like
I don't care what happened 50 years ago, like
You know, you know, you know, call-- all bets are off, bitches
You know, game just begun[Intro]
Ayo, ayo Corey, listen man...
If there's one thing I can't stand it's, you know, these nondescripts
Acting like they don't know who the hell I am
You know what I mean  So that's why I gotta run down, nigga
You know, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, the black Hannah Montana
When I do it, it get done

[Verse 1]
You must not know who I am
I don't get the spot 'till 2 IM
Don't be mad, lil mama, cause you not in
Everybody wanna roll with the crew I'm in
Look, they wanna know why I'm posted at the bar
I tell them I'm just signing posters at the bar
But really, I don't know why I'm posted at the bar
Ya bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar
I get cake cause I always got a hustle
I prompt weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout my muscle
Club everyday, but that ho ain't me
Cause I be home with the scale like Do-Re-Mi
I mean I walk like Onami, I mean Naomi
I keep the thing on me
And you know it ain't a bitch that's got a thing on me, no
That's why he wanna go and put a ring on me

[Hook]
He be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
He be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
I be like, "A million here, a million there there"
A million in the air, I mean in the lair-lair

[Verse 2]
You must not know who I be
On my way to Tai-Chi off the L.I.E
Don't be mad cause you not a ninja like me
Think she badder than Nicki, that's a L-I-E
Bitches know I'm half gone, I got my ski mask on
You bitches is too busy getting T-bagged on
When I do it, it get done, two sticks in my bun
Pull up in the 6 hun, they be fixin the run
Corset, Louis Vuitton; it be cuppin' my boobs
I just left petite Vuitton, let me buckle my shoes
Wait, hold on, little daddy, let me fix my suit
I got that presidential cooch; when he see it he salute
I am the mistress, stay with a rasta
If you get at him, I'll turn your brain into pasta
On 'em spaceships, yup we came in with NASA
Even out in Mars we the stars, oh my god

[Hook 2]
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
We be like, "a million here, a million there, there"
"A million in the air, I mean in the lair, lair"

[Verse 3]
You must not know who I are
Sucka-sucka MCs call me sire
I'm the ninja; my ad-libs say "hi-ya!" (Hi-ya!)
Konichiwa -- sayonara
Listen, I am the girl, the girl they call Nicki
I am young Nicki, finicky so picky
And I am like Jada, Halle and Kimora
No I'm not in church but this is Christian Dior-ah
I'm not impressed, I'm not impressed with you
I'mma need a lot of cheese and some mustard too
Cause I get more green then the vegetable
They say I'm rude, Yeah I'm rude like huxtable
I mean Rudy, I'm tutti-frutti
And I got some good cookies so they blew it and took it
I'm so Marylin Monroe
When the wind blow I'm Marylin Monroe

[Hook 3]
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
We be like, "A million here, a million there there
A milli in the air, I mean in the lair lair"[Verse 1]
Lemme tell a lil' story, about this dude I knew, he said -
Used to go to school out in L.I.U, he said -
He'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd
Show me the city,from a bird's eye view, said he -
Came from Jamaica, he had a lil' paper
He owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors
That's how we got together, on the bike -
Late night, Kawasaki leathers (Ah huh!) He used to -
Wine and dine me,dom and sex and we be -
Arm and armor, 'Mani dress and see I ain't need
A leprechaun, or four leaf clover, I just -
Woke up one morning,and he copped the Rover, see  -
I knew about them girls, he had back then, but -
I was getting money, I ain't care bout them, cause -
They was getting G's, I had M's, I used to -
Split my dividends, with all my friends, cause -
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like -
In and out of town,moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, cause them bitches was mad -
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see -
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the  -
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some -
Bitch, named Dawn, used to fuck LaiQwan and
Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond
Yeah, chicken noodle bitches, like a pack of Ramen
They had it out for me, kidnapped my brother
At the rucker, cause he used to put it down for me

[Talking: Nicki Minaj]

There ain t no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I got no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving
At the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station (Damn)
Not I, tattle-telling is for homos
Besides, thats the Number 1 Young Money no-no
Police, we don t chat with them
We ain t got no rap for them
You in the cop car pointing niggas out from the back of them (There he go)
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I m black, then you's a fucking goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor

Gimmie the heebie jeebies, so excuse my twitches
Excuse me! Lemme get that brewski
Niggas know them bitches can t do it like I dooski

And I just heard you running with the lieutenant

Yes, uh huh, Washington
Better ask around, cause I m what's popping-ton

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant
I bring it to your door step, loose lips sink ships nigga
So I ma bring you to the bottom of the ocean
Uh, church, I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck 'em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect 'em, I could AK or tech 'em
Ay, you looking at a gangster in his essence
Now, bitch, bow down when a gangster in your presence
'Cause I m God s gift like a present
For one, don t try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em
Gudda Gudda, biatch!

Write my own shit, ya'll copyrighting infringement
I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name, up on his ligament
Fuck wrong with them, my nerves they keep tweaking'
Tell them I'm the chief, I'm runnin' with Mohikans
Tell them this is church, and tell them I am the deacon
Tell them that I'm Black, Chinese and Butter Pecan
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin' them more reasons
Hit up Lil' Wayne, while I'm in the 4 Seasons
Tell Gudda, Mack and Kid Kid I'm here
I'm colder than a cough,I'm wetter than swimwear
Got all these little bitches, g-gettin' p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office, with flowers and pink chairs (chairs)

Listen... Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinksy... where the fuck is the president [Intro]
This one goes out to you
Yeah
You know who you are
Look

[Verse]
I guess I'm wrong for thinking that I could trust you
For never holding all of that sh- against you
But now I'm strapped with my .45 special
I'm so special, so special, so special
Nigga, you softer than a homosexual
And I am so extraterrestrial
So you can keep my things, there's nothing you can bring
And you can have my ring, you can add it to your bling
'Cause I'm okay and I'm still a G
Pray for my enemies, my name's still Nicki
In time you'll change, but time don't freeze
You better leave before you get wetter than Pisces[Intro]
Uh!
Kyuh!
Rrrrrrrr

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'ma give 'em what they asked for
On my James Brown flow with my afro (Uh)
Tell 'em meet me in the back though
And they better have my motherfuckin' cash flow
When I'm chillin' out in Houston with the Astros
And they know that I get flyer than an acrobat
They can't see me from the back row, back
I shut it down with my clique though, clack
I know what I don't know
Always pregnant with some sons but I don't show (Uh)
New York, I'm in SoHo
Gotta hit the UK for some promo (Uh)

Yo, I know not to doze off
All the boys wanna see me with my clothes off (Uh)
V.I.P. and it's closed off
Wanna kiss him 'cause his lips look so soft (Uh)
Gotta tell em hoes hold off
None of them could've did what I pulled off (Uh)
Doors up when I pulled off
And I been good with that mic like a Bull's court
Why you tryna get up all in it
Do you golf 'cause you tryna put your balls in it 
Uh, I'm just asking a question
Is you driving or is you a pedestrian 
Could I come through your crib with my best friend 
Could I ride that uh like equestrians  (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
On it, I'm not entertained
Me and you are not the same
Bringing it back like Rogaine
Let us do us like romaine
I think I'm insane
I think I'm insane
On it, I'm not entertained
I think I'm insane

That s why, I pull up to the curb, like fuck's the word 
You know, I keep the twenty-two tucked, in the girdle
Had to leak one of my bitches off, Throop and Myrtle
Put the shells to your back, now they callin' you turtle
See, if you wanna laugh, you can laugh
But nigga, get my money, get my cash, get my math
See everything s funny 'til that ass gettin' trashed
I'm getting dirty money, like my stash need a bath, see boys 
If it don t make cents, then it don t make dollars
When broke niggas holler, I just pop my collars
The dope boys get it, yeah, the dope boys cool
But, the white boys say, they be like, "Nicki s rules!"
Like, you got money, 'cause you re sittin' on dubs
Where your company, nigga where your pay stubs 
Look I'm on the grind and I'm lookin' for the grub
Fifty in the club, and we lookin' for the bub
Talkin' 'bout you wanna enjoy me, first you gon 
Need to get a couple employees, get it 
Get your money right, get your money right, right 
Then you can bite, you know this something tight, tight
You know I smoke bitches, I'mma need a light, light

While y'all motherfuckers was talking that K-Mart shit
Every two days my man was movin' four to six bricks
And cop me a five bedroom house, two car garbage, three full baths
I love it when you run your mouth
Jag' in the driveway, sittin' right next to the Rover
Bitch, I ain't never been over
Broke ass runnin' around talkin' about I'm popped
Bag and shoes, 'bout a G each, bitch, what you got 
I keep a fresh pair of 7's on
Bitch, you still got 54 11's on
Since when I gave a fuck about this rappin' shit 
While you waitin' 'round for record deals, I'm stackin', bitch
I blow your budget in a day, your advance the same night
Before you talk left, bitch, get your game tight
Bitch, I get money, money I got
Bitch, I don't come outta pocket, I let a nigga cop it

[Chorus: Milk Dee]
I get money, money I got

I guess you musta heard I m the baddest bitch around
So it is going down like a mother fucking frown

When they see me, they go uhh, leave them bitches in the dirt
When they see me they go ohh yeah bitch there puts in work
And I m fucking with the P ( ) so I make that pussy squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt

If you want it, come and get it, you can have it for dessert
You can eat it with some cherries like you eating Ben and Jerry s
And uh uh, this is nt scary this is very necessary

At the club every day but that ho ain t me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell  em to bring it back, tell  em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

[Verse 2]
I hate a dude that be actin  like he get dough
But you know money short like Sisco
Actin  like he got funds for days
Tryna act like a mac, yeah the one with dame
I hate a dude with a mad, bling-a-bling
That shit don t make up, for no wack ding-a-ling
I hate a dude, that be pushin  a Benz
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends
Nigga please, what the fuck you done for me
Say you run your company, but can't have company
I guess the Lord just be tryna humble me
How the fuck you eatin  tuna and it's not bumblebee

When I step up in the spot that's a wrap

[Verse 3]
I hate a girl that be stuntin  in the game
Iced out chain with her best friend name
Cuz them the girls that be swervin  in my lane
Why they lookin  for change in they boyfriend Range
I hate a clown touch down to my town
But when the check come she short like bust downs
I hate a girl stay singin  in public
Everywhere I go bitch be singin  some dumb shit (shut the fuck up)
If I could get a deal I'd have one too
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that s my boo (stop playing)
It make you mad when they front like they right
They need help like they only got 5 on it

I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it backYou have to be like a beast. You have to be a beast. That s the only way they respect you. I came up under Wayne, and Wayne has his way of doing things. When Wayne walks up on the motherfuckin' set and-and say, "Don t talk to me, have my fucking music ready, get the fuck up out of my face, I mma blow this shit in your fucking face all day, it s cool. But every time I -- every time I put my foot down and stand up for myself, it s like, "We ve heard about Nicki Minaj! Nicki Minaj shut down a photo shoot! Oh my god! No one wants to work with Nicki Minaj!"

I m glad you heard. Now, when I come to a photoshoot, let it be of quality. You know why  Because I put quality in what I do. I spend time, and I spend energy, and I spend effort, and I spend everything I have, every fiber of my being to give people quality. So if I turn up to a photoshoot and you had -- you got a fifty dollar clothes budget and some sliced pickles on the motherfucking board, you wanna know what  No, I am gonna leave. Is that wrong  For wanting more for myself  Wanting people to treat me with respect  But you know what  Next time they know better. But I had accepted the pickle juice, I would be drinking pickle juice right now

When I am assertive, I m a bitch. When a man is assertive, he s a boss. (He bossed up.) He bossed up! No negative connotation behind "bossed up." But lots of negative connotation behind being a bitch

Donald Trump can say, "You re fired!" Let Martha Stewart run her company the same way and be the same way! "Fuck, oh, evil bitch." But Donald Trump, he gets to hang out with young pussies and have 50 different wives and just be cool  "Oh, Donald we love ya. Donald Trump " But when you re a girl, you have to be like  everything. You have to be -- you have to be dope at what you do, but you have to be super sweet, and you have to be sexy, and you have to be this, and you have to be that, and you have to be nice, and you have to  It s like, I can t be all those things at once. I m a human being  I don t mean to be ranting and raving like this. I don t -- don t use this footage, please; it s just gonna make me look stupid[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Shorty wanna li li li li lick me like a lollipop

Shorty wanna li li lick me in the candy apple drop
I got that presidential cooch, when he see it he salute
Cause ain't no nappy pubes, just alot of juice
A little mohawk, posing for the Photog
He get me so, he get me so, he get me so smart
He make my pussy sing "Ahhhhh!", like it's Mozart
He say the pussy pretty, it look like show art
He say who pussy is it, and I say yours
And when he spank this, I make that pussy fart
I'm such an actress, Melissa Joan Hart[Intro]
Okay. Okay. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm 'bout to master these bitches, man. Chea! Chin checker

[Verse 1]
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to Cali
Used to push a pink Denali, now it's Chevy Impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys
Now I get my work it out like Biggity-Bally
I used to go hard, used to cock the brim
Used to take the dollar car, used to shop at Vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean Cover Girl when I say "easy breezy."
Jiminy Cricket, let the master in
When it come to bad bitches, I'm the last of kin
I'm bringing S-E-X-Y B-A-C-K
If Nicki ain't the best, suck a D-I-C-K
I'm Young Nicholas, my style ridiculous
I heard your money funny, and mommy, I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict

[Interlude]
I don't know man. I think these bitches is real scared right now, like. Damn. I got these bitches shaking in they boots, man. Dirty money. Ayo, Pre'. Bring the next verse in, my nigga. Chea! Chea! Chea! One time

[Verse 2]
I used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind
They think I'm making fun of them, when I be like: "Na-Na-Na-Na!"
That's the track, little mama. Look: "Na-Na-Na-Na!"
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me
Do it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics,  little mama, I can dig it
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic
Abracadab' tricks are for kids, silly rabbit

[Outro]
Yes sir. If I ain't the one, who is, nigga  I mean damn, I don't mean to toot my own goddamn horn, but toot-toot, nigga! Fuck! I'm that bitch. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. Yes sir. Uh-huh. Uh-huhPink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set

Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran  When  Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land 
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha

[Verse 1]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first  I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Just got a collect call from Hector, I was on the phone
Outside of my double decker, Margiela umbrella
Pop trunk in stormy weather, on who  Cinderella
Lobster for breakfast, necklace playin' checkers
Hold up that wrist, her thong red licorice
Pre-rolls filled, Aliz  and prescription filled
Codeine dreams, I lean like Stojakovi 
I ain't top five  What the H-E-double hockey sticks 
My left hand was an avalanche
My right hand, uh, eight grand, finna traffic jam
Doors locked, hundred K on the Porsche box
My socks, got glow-in-the-dark rocks
LA Leakers, bustin' out the speakers
Keep your mouth closed when JODY HiGHROLLER speakin'
Ass cheeks like two volleyballs
Neon spandex turnin' heads at the damn mall
I'll lay down 'fore I lift off
In this Lamborghini plane, seats sure are super soft

So I pull up, Mike Myers[ ] on the tires

Said you know me, I know you
And you don't gotta be like that[Verse 1]
Yo, I am such a dancehall queen

Why d you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene Summer night
I wish that you would've waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you're gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda

[Hook]
Why d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 2]
Why couldn t you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my pride aside to come and find you
I could've told you about the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you moved on so fuck you
Should ve known from day one I couldn t trust you

[Hook]
Why d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 3]
Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
If you in a better place, then you re free
Well then, why can t they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn t mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bulletproof
And I m mad cause
You re the best that I ve ever had

Why d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

I got a fetish for boys, that's pushing them nice toys
A fetish for dem boys, that's fresher than altoids, I got a -
Thing for a dude, in a fresh pair of Mauri's
If he rocking 'em right, then I might let him call me
He put the Prada bag, with the Prada heels wid it
The Louis dufflebag, had about a mil' in it
From here to Trinidad, man I should've been did it
Cause everything I had, I just doubled them digits
That's the kinda dude, that can roll with the President
Sit up in the Rolls maybe, roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi,, he love my spaghetti
He let me do my thing, he ain't never act petty
If he ringing, I'm dipping, put the ring in my lip and
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think 
Now he spending and tricking, so the chickens is tripping

That mean I live by the beach
Sand on the welcome mat, flyer than a Falcon
Black tires, black rims, just to help em look good
In the summer, my car look better than your woman
My woman look better than your momma
And I don't wanna name, or number, just some brain from her, naw
I ain't came in a Hummer, that's a Bentley Marlow on her
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners, I'm a gunner
Like a hunter with a gun, with a deer right in front 'em
I'mma send him to who brung him, let Nina Ross Tongue him
Oh back to the subject, I'm balling without a budget
I'm a big spender, but I ain't done yet

Cause I'm the President, run up in ya resident
Say hello to the (gunshot) baddest bitch ya ever met
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
Sawed-off followed by the Mossberg Pump
When I come through it get hotter than a soup kitchen
I leave clips in your head like a beautician

Straight up, you can take this with you on the way down
Or way up, as long as my money gets paid up

Get ate up, you see how much space your boy take up
Usually I'm calm though but when it come to long dough
I don't aim for the vest, hit you from the face up
When it's in a palm dough turn into a John Doe
I'm psycho, I think about this shit when I wake up
I don't want to starve kids, I want y'all to all live
So I'm gonna retire in a Lambo like Favre did
Aw shit, news flash dummy, I'm acting juvenile, that new cash money
It's buck, buck, buck, if dude act funny
I already told niggas don't do that to me

She's so pretty, she know they want her, but -
She's so sididdy, they can't afford her,  but -
All the boys stare, when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway, head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights, beam bright, got the best boobs
I call her double R (Range Rover), my rough rider
We hit a couple malls, then the Ramada
Cause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter, than a coke bottle
She super charge cars, anything for Minaj
And she could only park, in the superstar garage
Cause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask
Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod 
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

[Hook: Eminem]
I feel ugly (x3)
Slut don't touch me or hug me
I'm mad and I pity any girl who gets with me tonight

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You wanna sleep on me  Overnight 
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why 
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask 
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!

Ya girl been hot since Corduroys

Try to beat like the corner boys
'Cause they heard the pussy wetter, than themDorney rides
Fuck with who  Fucks with you
As long as them checks clear like Huxtable
I m known to hang, with a thug or two
Niggas that only do, what a thug would do
Ask about me, the FEDS watch daily
Gettin  more cheese, more bread than a deli
And I m getting  love, fan mail like Melly
And I throw it up, twelve o clock when I wheelie
I m in the A, I scoop my nigga J
Coupe gotta be grey, you gotta get paid
Ain t nothin  worse, than being a broke bitch
I always got crack, I tell  em to smoke this

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, ya boy been nice since thunder cats
Since leather boomers and lumber jacks
Come outside with a hundred stack
Jeans with the sweat pants under that, yeah

Niggas know I keep the seventeen shot on me
Made a lil something off rap, lot off D
Get your points off another nigga, not off me

Hundred dollars of pussy, my misses getting  busy
FEDs getting dizzy, niggas trying to get me
So I change the sizzy combination, to the cizzy
Brand new V, that s what I get for pitchin
Nice little crib, a couch that I could sit in
Umm, I mean sit on, blow piff, fuck a bitch on
Oops, I mean feller, keeps the umbrell-er
And I only fuck with them paper makers
Nicki Lewinski, LK to Jada[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim stay on y'all brains
Nothin' ass broads tryin' to come up off my name
And i don't even know these bitches though
Come to think about it, i never even seen em before
Miserable birds, rather see me singing the blues
Walkin' round barefoot, give them my shoes
Let 'em live off me till my bank is bruised
So i fucked up and back in the hood with you
Homegirl, don't believe that song
That bitch is wrong, snakes don't live that long
Quick to leave a bitch in the atlantic ocean
Hypnotize niggas with that honey bee potion
I like fast money, y'alls come in slow motion
Frank left me the formula son, i'mma take it and run
Fall back, what's done is done
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Wait a minute, let me skate up in it
I see your face got the hate up in it
The briefcase got the cake up in it
Call me Lil Wayne,ma' your girl make it rain
These silly rappers don't impress me
I'm eating red snappers on a jet ski
I mean, I gotta giggle, I gotta laugh a little
Mami, I been hot since Monie was in the middle
Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kimberly
When you see the squad, bitches better salute like an assembly
Come on mami, I got dudes that will kill for me
These broke bitches got it in for me

Rep the NY like an apple do
Step to these broads like a Kappa do
Boo, You sold a million, now you half of who 
Get off my dick, kick it bitch[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks trick or treating the clutch
Come on nigga, is you tricking or what 
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs and bamboo
White girls tell me, "Hey, Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos "
Asalaamalaikum, no oink for me
And I never let a D-boy boink for free
Cause it's barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I done penny, nickel, dimed, I done coined the phrase
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer
Indian-style court side with a cavalier
VIP Roseau's you can have a beer
Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Now Roger that, Rroger that. Roger that, Rroger that

He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep his wave on swim
Wa wa waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cuz I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays me
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Now I m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don t come to the hood 
How they turn they nose up like they don t come from the hood 
Most of them be in sight til it s time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can t do no more

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn t see it in her

Now I m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They ll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They ll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain t know
They airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin 
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant
Air Force, the Army, Air Force and Army
Fatigues is on him, no heats is on him
Cause grandmama prayed, that he d leave the corner

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn t see it in her
Now I ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire 23 s on my tire
Shout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas, that be huggin  the block
Two Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops
Three Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
Look, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son
Well look, when you blow up everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

But if your money short like midgets, keep ya digits
 Cause I don t fucks with y all Jokers, when it come to money
 Cause ain t a damn thing funny, understand me dummy
Slide out the batmobile, hat on tilt
Got the cherry red pumps with the matching belt
New heroine in town, check the roster girl
I m comin  for the crown, Kim, that s the word
Flashy in the drop, low key in the bird
Ratchet on the top, so don t get on my nerve
Get his wood down, like a lumberjack
Let the hood know Nicki got that thunder cat
But I don t fucks with y all dudes, that be fronting when you come through

Tryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than
Rollin' up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine
It's high noon & I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff
Me and Nicki's like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't be embarrassed
I'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage
But I still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret
'08 Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard
Turn it into a coupe, and now the roof's gone
Word to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on
See it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps, so move on
Before I act like a Autobot and transform
Too hot and I ain't Mims
I flip bricks while you little clown still buyin' rims
Who's in charge  Stop frontin' like I ain't him
I'm Saks Fifth Ave, you still shop at Fims
Superstar with the Audemar and a pair of Timbs
Who your wives screwing  Flossin', I been doin'
Fuckers

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up

Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up

[Verse 1, Nicki Minaj]
Fuck I look like, coppin' denim and tops
Niggas wanna book me, but they ain't spendin' no guap
That's why I pull up to the curb, like fucks the world
You know I keep the .22 tucked in the girdle
Had to leak one of my bitches off Throop and Myrtle
Put the shells to your back, now they callin' you turtle
See, if you wanna laugh, you can laugh
But nigga, get my money, get my cash, get my math
See, everything's funny 'till that ass gettin trashed
I'm gettin dirty money like my stash need a bath
See, boys, if it don't make sense, then it don't make dollars
When broke niggas holla, I just pop my collars
The dope boys get it, yeah, the dope boys cool
But the white boys say, they be like "Nicki rules"
Like ya got money, 'cause you're sittin' on dubs
Where your company, nigga  Where your pay stubs 
Look, I'm on the grind and I'm lookin' for the grub
50 in the club and we lookin' for the bub
Talkin' 'bout you wanna interjoin me
First, you gon' need to get a couple employees, get it
Get your money right, get your money right, right
Then you can bite, you know this somethin' tight, tight
You know I smoke bitches, I'mma need a light, light
Coogi on my coochie, size 3, white nikes, yeah!

[Chorus]
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I-I get money, money I got
M-money I got, M-money I got

[Verse 2, Amil]
While y'all motherfuckers was talking that K-Mart shit
Every two days, my man was movin' 4-6 bricks
And I copped me a 5 bedroom house
2 car garage, 3 full baths, I love it when you run your mouth
Jag in the driveway, sittin' right next to the Rover
Bitch, I ain't never been over
Broke ass runnin' 'round, talkin' 'bout "I'm popped"
Bag and shoes 'bout a G each, bitch. what you got 
I keep a fresh pair of sevens on
Bitch, you still got 54'11's on, uh
Since when I gave a fuck about this rappin' shit
While you waitin' 'round for record deals, I'm stackin' bitch
I blow your budget in a day, your advance the same night
Before you talk next, bitch, get your game tight
Bitch I get money, money I got
Bitch I don't come outta pocket, I let a nigga cop it

[Chorus]
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got (I get it)
I-I get money, money I got (I, I, I get it)
I-I get money, money I got (I, I, I get it)
M-money I got, M-money I got (Yeah, I run New York)
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
M-money I got, M-money I got

[Verse 3, Lil' Kim]
The bank don't stop 'cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can, what the fuck 
I'll have a baby by you, baby, if you a billionaire
Write the check before I come, just sign right here
I'mma stay rich, I ain't gon' die tryna spend my shit
I'mma die tryna spend your shit
Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen B gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amateur shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick 
She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being conceited, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceiling, I get it
The lifestyle you only rap about, I live it
My man buy me cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like the Phantom, you a Honda Civic
Lil Kim got your whole bank stock, I get it!
Bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, yeah
See, you can call this the Rem-mix, but it ain't Rem, though
It's Shesus Khryst, I switched up my M.O
The BX savior, gimme that paper
I'm passin' out the collection plates
'Cause I get gully, bust a shot right at your favorite rapper
Really kill hip-hop, see, I'm gettin that guap
Hater, you just a Rem fan
I put haters in trunks and I don't mean swim pants
I talk gun talk and people believe me
But that's how I do it when I do it for TV
Tryna stop my cash flow, I flips on you assholes
My itinerary full, I got mad shows
I'm goin overseas to see R to the Easy
At that currency exchange, I get that Euro easy
And my hair be fresh, my gear be fresh
I got last year, this year, and next, 'cause

[Chorus]
I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
M-money I got, M-money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
M-money I got, M-money I got Cause I get wetter than umbrellas
And I m groovier than stella
I m flyer than a flier could you get me some repeller
I I mean I need repellent t-t-taste like watermellon
I m buying if you selling
If you lying then I m telling

I supersize fries and the m is for Minaj
Heard you a dopeboy and I stay around your heart
I got some good pie it could get a nigga shot
So I g-g-get more eyes than the letter with the dot

Le-le-let me let me stop
Le-le-let me make it pop
You need some good box like you playing hopscotch
So let s go and get the chalk
My Naomi Campbell walk
 Cause I m a bad bitch like bark

Uh Shawty I wanna know if you got hang time
And if you think that you could beat it by a landslide
Don t lie you could see it in my eyes
I got some good cookies and I got some good pie
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me

Damn every time I seen her, it was just the thought of break up
But you know niggas and girls how they quit, then they make up

She told me she been in love with me ever since we were in 6th grade
Ms. Hills' class, I'm just thinkin', ah, oh
Mighty funny didn't notice her back then
But now her body bangin', got me thinkin', ah, oh

I mean my ring so big it just bruise my knuckle
And I just heard that you was back on the market
Let me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it

'Cause you and me, we should be together
Cop da matchin' Lamborghini, Swahili leather
Now dat dat dat dat's black on black
And if the bitch call ya phone, that's a back hand smack

[Verse]
Ayo, once upon a time, there lived a little bad bitch
I just press the buttons on my little gadgets
Born in December, so I am a Sagittarius
Maybe just a little bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command
I mean I really, really mean it
'Cause I am the lady that was on I Dream of Jeannie
They call it spaghetti but I call it linguini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet, it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, oh, you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But fuckin' with my money is a no-no, man
I got them Bar-billions, they call me Cole-man

HA!You know, a lot of people ask me why I feel that, you know, I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And I don t know, people seem to be under the impression that I ve made it to this point fast
And, you know, obviously for me, I don t feel like that
'Cause it's me, you know  I feel like I ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don t realize how far you ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know 
It's not going to be about connections
It s not gonna be about my looks
It's gonna be about who wants it the most
And I want it the mostSee, my niggas don t dance, make you switch up your plans and
Put your rocks away
I take that
I take that
We take that
We take that
Nicki not easy, ya bitches come triz-I
The 9 millimizzy, ya brains fly biz-I
Poppin  chains and trains, that s how my dudes get biz-I
I m a winner, mami, can t lose if I triz-I
Ya bitches in the game gon  respect my name
With or without the fame, bring it to you the same
I shock ho s, fuck around Nicki pop ho s
Don t doze, I m  bout to blow like a snot nose
I got flow, which one you want 
I can keep it street and sneak, so get it crunked and pumped
Wait up, look mami, don t getcha hate up
Fix yo little makeup and getcha cake up
You s a potato chip bitch, I m tryna get my stake up
Brushin  my shoulders off like the Harlem shake
Uptown, I get around, but I don t fuck with clowns
Ask your niggas in the hood, they know I shut you down[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, Okay, Me, I'm the Barbie, Im supa hot
When I'm at the dealership, Should I get the coop or not 
Should I get the roofer truck  Should I get the choo choo truck 
Yeah I get them bookoo bucks, cuckoo for the Cocoa Puffs
I'm cuckoo for Cuckoo Puff, got money in my Louis duff
Plus I got a nasty flow. Bitch, I spit the gooey stuff!
Its going D-O-W-N, I am the barbie where the fuck is Ken, Ken, Ken 
I be on 1.7 in the rock, that's my block
New York City to the top, tippy top, bust a shot
I said, I be on 1.7 in the rock, that's my block
New York City to the top, tippy top, bust a shotIt's been 7 days of constant rain
I miss you, oh I miss you
Feeling swept away there's no barricade without you
What can I do

And everything protecting me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm....

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

I could try to change
But nothing fits the way that
You do, oh yeah you do
From every strangers eyes you're my best diguise
I need you
I still need you

And everything that comforts me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm...

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

The moments we share are all that I wear
It's colde without you
Now I have to try to get through another night

Cuz I feel...

Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

        You're trying to tell me you're saying goodbye
I'm watching you leaving not believing my eyes
You'd better be looking over your shoulder
Cause I know too much for this to be over
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it
What once was good is gone like innocence we watched it dying
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it, can't hide it
Let it go...
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it, let it go...
I always hoped that this would last forever
Just you and me against the world
What once was powerful has weakened now we can't pretend
What once was right is wrong like everything this game must end
Oh baby, the lies and deception
We're gonna bring each other down
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it
Let it go (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you, told you, let it go[Spoken Word]
You know, when I went out to Ohio, there was like a mini riot
And, you know, we thought it was, like, Michael Jackson, you know 
So we was just looking for the gloves and the two little white kids with the silk wrapped around they face
You know, 'cause the people were just going crazy
They was screaming and, you know, yelling
And I turn around...[Nicki Minaj] Verse 1
Uh , Yo , Yo , Yo
I'm the bad *woof!*, 'bout to get a mani-ped
I'm the big bad wolf and your granny dead
Even though I'm in Mexico, I rep New York like Plexico
Look, switch my name, now I'm celebrating Hannukah
Lewinsky, bitches, Young Money Monica
I been hot since hedgehog, Sonic the
So, could you pass me the keys to the Tonica 
I mean Tonka, that's the truck, bitches
Fuck you and all of you fuck bitches
Matter fact, put some sprinkles on my cupcakes
And get ready to put your dimples in this duct tapeHoliday, Holiday, slow that shit down!
Come on now, they done, they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done, two sticks in my bun
But, but first of all, when I say "two sticks in my bun"
I mean that, when I put a bun in my hair
Like, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay 
But Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin 
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
Now, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know 
Um, they wanna hear me sing
You know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl
There's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um
Now it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist
I mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where
I just wanna be more, you know, delicate and wet (splash)
I'm, I'm, I'm so... I, I didn't mean to say that
I meant that, you know, Holiday, just slow it down, daddy![Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first  I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
 Fuck these petty niggas  is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax every bitch follow

Big fat ass, big dicks follow
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Big fat ass, big dicks follow
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a woman of my word, ain't a coochie that's fatter
D-D-Don't compare me to them girls, they drier than Nevada
If she wanna step to me, she better go get a ladder
Cause we up in VIP, she better move like Mick Jagger
Cause I win, win, win
Rocking designers you ain't never been in
My bitches pretty, you would never fit in
Ain't sharing bottles, we don't ever chip in
You on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say 
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

I got next
It's my time
I got next
To get mine
I got next
And it don't matter
What they say
We gon' make it

[Verse 1]
This is for the little girls
That say "Nicki, you pretty."
When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block
Or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up
And don't come to the hood
How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid
That can't do no more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This is for my lil homies
That be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes
They be passing they digits
Carry up on the block
Getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school, getting off
Whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough
Might break in your joe
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter
They can't turn no dodge
No matter the squadron
Lieutenant or sergent
Air force the army
Air force in army
Four teets is on 'em
No heat is on 'em
'Cause grandmama prayed
That he leave the corner

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember when I lost
Everything in a fire
And now I got fire
23s on my tire
Shoutout to my brothers
Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah
My money getting higher
One time for my niggas
That be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas
That be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls
That pushing they own ride
Specially they own life
Bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad
When I blaze the gun
I see you without a man
May I raise your son
But look, when you blow up
Everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody
On the come up

Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men 
He- hey hey hey Barbie! Hey I can be your black Ken
Wow! 'Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat, and after that
Everything went black

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

(Lil Wayne - Verse 2)
Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara  Haha
Hey Barbie! Can I call you tomorrow, and today 
'Cause once you go black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
Then she threw that ass back, back, back, then I fell to the mat
And after that everything went black

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

(Nicki Minaj - Verse 3)
Awe fuck it
Give me that damn bucket
Wh-when I throw this pussy

You better not start duckin'
Oh yo
Hit 'em with the blow
Lo-look out in the crowd
And everybody's yellin' "NO!"
Grab him by his locks
And give us a good box
Hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
Top, top
Give him good top
Hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
1,2,3
They yellin' 1,2,3
I done hit him with that motherfuckin' court two piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out
To late to cop out
Give him more head than tupee's that's the knockout

(Nicki Minaj - Chorus)
Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

So, what's a Barbie to do  I mean.. it's like...
It's like I'm the baddest Barbie in the fucking world, I mean
Come on now, it's Barbie bitch!
(sheesh, sheesh, stop, stop)

[Chorus: Aqua]

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, I was on my way to school, I do's me
I hopped out the drab grabbed my juice-y
I hop skipped and jumped past them hoopdies
But wait, I forgot to grab my loose sleeves
I doubled right b-back like "Who's that "
I did a little dance like b-kat-b-boom-kat
I like how the jocks be watching me, man
So I grabbed my crotch and said "hee-hee"
I be like bum stickety bum while I popped my gum
They looking dumb dickety dumb think they stopped in some
Uh, I said excuse me honey, I'm B-Bugs Bunny
No more funny - ain't got my carrots he ain't got nothing from me
'Cause we the Mean Girls "yes, we're so fetch"
And when we in the yard - be jumping double dutch
We Back To The Future - Pearl, you were the best!
Now I got everybody looking at me
I got everybody looking at me

[Chorus: Aqua]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!

[Verse 2:  ]
She lives fantasies, my life's dreams are plastic
Her goals are stretched out, my goals arent elastic
Below average D's, same time, she's fantastic
She's the tip of the iceberg, I'm below water (gigantic)
She's a barbie girl - just perfect and flawless
Lives in Utopia, so care free - lawless
I'm stuck in hell, better yet, this place called Earth
Where humans degrade humans over materialistic worth
Where three dollar cotton turns into a three hundred dollar shirt
But Barbie, get that matching three hundred dollar skirt
Maybe it's Maybelline or maybe the people behind it
And if you don't understand that then you can just rewind it
It's okay, I can take some time and wait
'Cause I can spill my heart here but half of you can't relate
And turn around and just debate
Whether Nicki Minaj's verse is real or is it fake 

[Chorus: Aqua]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!

Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life is plastic, its fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere!
Imagination, life is your creation!
Come on Barbie, lets go party!
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

[Outro: Aqua]
Oh, I'm having so much fun!
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started!
Oh, I love you Ken![Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
The disgusting pig this person is
Calling a dead child a monkey, but telling people somebody talked about your child that never talked about your motherfucking child
So you can get some fucking sympathy points 

They can't feed they fuckin  family
Because you mad at what another man stickin' his dick inside of
You mad... you mad at a woman for what a man is doin'
And that s a problem with so many black women and women, period
Oh, 'cause she's not black, she refers to you black women...
Oh we got the receipts for that too...
FYI, she refers to black women as monkeys and roaches
ROACHES!
These are the women going hard... for her... the roaches... when the lights come out...

[Laughing in background]

They stay scrambling, the roaches, chile! We roaches!
Black women is roaches now!
We roaches, be clear!
Now, I'ma say... no!
So there are two beautiful women right now...
Who... who... have been accused of...
Whoever they slept with, and you know, whatev...
And so they were, you know, allegedly attacked
And are cut up everywhere...
But oh, not by women, men!
You sent a man to beat on women!
Lemme tell you... I'ma say it again...
What's sad is that a lot of times a man can hurt a woman so badly
That she no longer even knows who she's angry at
And what happens is... first of all let's get on 1-800 number for Postpartum Depression
Because, let me tell you something, that s nothing to joke about
You just had the biggest blessing of your life with a child
And in two week you have attacked three women 
One at Fashion Week, and left looking the way you left looking so that people could point their fingers at our culture and at our community and laugh at us some more 

[Laughing and talking in the background]

Lemme tell you something, a woman cannot give your man pussy
If he doesn t stick his dick in there
Who are you angry at, sweetheart 
And you wanna let your publicist write something about stopping bags !
Do you know what the fuck it is to sit in your fucking room for hours and days at the time writing raps !
You came into my fucking culture!
I've never had to fuck a DJ to play my songs!
This is not funny and this is not about attacking
This is about getting this woman some fucking help!
This woman is at the best stage of her career and she s out here throwing bottles and throwing shoes !
Who the fuck is gonna get her a fucking intervention !
Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit!
You niggas don't care until somebody is fucking dead!
You niggas want somebody to fucking die until y'all stop!
Until you stop this bullshit, laughing at this shit, this shit ain't fuckin  funny!
You put your hands on certain people, you gon' die!
Period!
I'm not the bitches in the strip club
And I'm not a bitch on a reality show

(Like that)
So don't act like its easy for you to miss me like thatBefore I begin, I would like to note that I am not a "Barb"   that s not to be taken as a negative statement, but rather to let you, the reader, know that my opinions aren t biased

With that out of the way, I am someone who extremely respects the accelerated rise of a superstar - and not just someone who tops the Billboard Hot 100 with one or two songs to later fade into non-relevance

Don t get me wrong, I'm all about artists having their "moment" - but creating that moment, while still a pretty monumental task, is the easy part. What's hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top

To become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers   because, let s face it, how can someone be labeled a  superstar  without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists 

And while it s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that   superstar

We all know the backstory   Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School (not because of her rapping, but acting), and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne s Young Money label

During the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the  First Lady of Young Money . After some persuasion, as well as a $5 million dollar signing-bonus, his dream became a reality

That following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album,  Pink Friday , a superstar began to emerge 

What s so ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for Nicki Minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isn t even the biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star

The real hurdle in her way, and one that has caused problems for many female rappers of this past decade, was making a name for herself in the male-driven and male-dominated world that is rap

With a large amount of guest appearances to her name   including being featured on songs by hip hop heavyweights Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Beyonc  and on songs by pop icons Mariah Carey, Madonna, and Britney Spears   Nicki made a name for herself by outshining her more-established peers on their own songs

As the most successful commercial female rapper of all-time, Nicki also proved that she could compete for airplay on Top 40 radio with smash hits like  Superbass ,  Starships , and  Moment For Life . No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres

Now, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals

If that s not the power of a superstar, then I don t know what isI find myself thinking about what you do
Though I know I m better off without you

You keep me guess, so I can play a game of double jeopardy
You got me wondering if you ever gonna make a move
If you would ask me, I would tell you that it's over, dude
Sometimes I just lie awake
And I rewind and replay everything that you say
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you

I promise I don't need to geek out
But if I ever got you home

Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie!
Keep a marquise, everything's sparkly (Man, man down!)
Hit em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em "let me in"
My name rings bells, bitch, buzz me in!
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbians
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9
Hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine
Hit em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always eat the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner 
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle;
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch - no muzzle. (no muzzle)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kentae
Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish ackes
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)Intro:
Plenty more for you, boy

But he can tell just by my face he ain't getting any

Yo, matter of fact, I think I'mma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I don't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf
Most of you rappers ain't eating, that diet is rough
You want some hot shit  Send that wire to us
I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff

She was making that noise, oh boy.Only had a little taste
But I remember how it felt
And all the phone calls late at night
Though we tried, we couldn`t make it right

When the seasons changed
Everything got colder
Everyone could hear, our illusion crush
It was all we had

So every minute that I ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could

Make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I m moving on
But I won`t forget
All that is unsaid

So every minute that I ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

It was so short
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It`s not yours to keep
Everything fades away
And now it s goneCymphonique, I'm in the house
A. K. A. Little miss Swagger
This for my soldier girls
Where all my soldier boys , tempo

You the one, yeah the one
The only one my heart beats for

Crazy how you've got me going
You're not the average one
Your swagger, your style
You got me caught in a dream
Let me sleep, I don't wanna wake up
I see you in the corner of my eye
Sometimes I just don't understand why

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

You the truth, you the one

[Nicki Minaj:]Why you doing this, why you doing this to me 
I am Lewinsky, I don't be doing this for free
I mean I am her, I mean I am her
I just came out of the fly fly, flying spur
I mean I was just looking for a shh to the D-boys
Stay around the key like the key to the keyboard
Anyway I'm back, I had to jump off that
Just jumped off the beach, I'm back on track
Ha ha ha ha ha, had to laugh on this one
You know I had to go and show my ass on this one
Linked up with Cymphonique, Little miss Swagger
Black on black bags, they bags from Mischa
Get the wizard of oz, got me clicking my feet
Cause he got my heart skip skip, skipping a beat

And we getting it in
Check the tempo, tempoYou said you've had enough
I've packed up all my stuff
I'm waiting for the cab in the hallway
I've got nothing to explain
I'm naked in the rain
Like every part of me is on display

Trying to act like everything's ok
No way

What did I do 
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do 
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do 

I know that you won't call
Won't talk to me at all
You left me in my less than perfect world
I'm done with feeling small
I really gave it all
Tried to be your stupid cover girl

You must be glad you finally had your way

What did I do 
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do 
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do 

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
Maybe looking back
Many years from now
When it's all to late to be sorry
You'll be thinking
What did I do 

Chorus:
What did I do 
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do 
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

What did I do 
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do 
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

I guess we'll never write this story

Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say
What the fuck they gon' say
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo

[Chorus]
Ah, it's OK
It's OK, long as you know
Long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best

Who the hell is this

While im watchin the fight
Lookin at the phone, there's no name in site
Blocked ID, knew somthin just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandy from out in Miami
Tellin me that my man with some bitch in the Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kand stop playin
What the fuck is you sayin

["Kandy"]
Rememba them chicks from the bricks round 96'
That we seen when we hit the lick by the projects

[Nicki]
Oh you mean Leah, Lil sister Maria
I use to go see her in front of the Pizzaria

["Kandy"]
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you know from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, use to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp warnin me, now I'm warnin you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

[Nicki]
Damn imma have to send her to her maker
Damn imma have to send her to her maker
Damn imma have to send her to her maker
(Imma) Send her to her maker
(Imma) Send her to her maker

["Kandy"]
They heard about his good sexin
Long erection, nice complexion
Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain ain't stop till the cum came
But thats word to Hip Hop
I'll pop the bitch top
Like a Carona

[Nicki]
Call the coroner!!
Its gonna be a lot of black dresses & chest vestes
If i find out he got a next misses
What you think all the goons is for
2 by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed em curry chicken
I'm all about my green, naw-mean
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox
And we cook oxtails
Got a scale for whats in the mail
I got watever on my nigga bail
But if the nigga bail
I have him sleepin with some killer whales
Damn! Bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in ya prom pictures, salon with ya
Now they wanna creep in ya man Jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cuz imma put the heat to ya beak
You bird like tweet tweet
And watch her smoke like a ciggarete
Shoulda left the bitch a pack of nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not runnin
Bitch i bust my gun and -
Hold on, I hear somebody comin

*bang bang bang*
Police open up!!

Oh shit
That bitch Kandy set me upI hang on every word you said and
No one could get inside my head like you
Then I guess I was a fool for you then
But now I understand
It was all part off your plan
And you should know that

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

Dear God if you can hear me know
Please stop the anger building up inside me
I need you to come and guide me
I look into the eyes
Of the one I thought was mine
And my only scream is

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

No one could get inside my head
You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heartI'm walking around in circles out of time
Spending out of focus like I lost my hand
Even though I know it's what you did
I'm not gonna show it

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Everytime you bruise me with your words
When you look right through me like you haven't heard
It doesn't really matter
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Tear drops are frozen, in everything you had
I m stuck in the moment, you're never getting back
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try

Proving it, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
No, no, no, nooo

Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
Walking around in circles out of time

Won't ask no questions
I'm craving your presence
There's no prescription
To get me over you
Been thinking lately
You'll say yes not maybe
Just speak the words
And we'll go back to

I heard that they knocking
I m sending them bitches up London
Then roll and uplift them, get higher than Blundy
I bled it, her cranium, peg-ity bundy it
Sorta, Just like how that nigga Ted bundy did
Ice on my foreigns, departed the tie-
Tenant, you bitches ain t paying ya bribe!
Chucky these leeches is hurtin  ya pride!
Knocking right, switch all they inner left sides
Nicki these bitches been plottin  since day 1
You just keeping ballin , like gimme the D1
Me, ima killa , then set up camera
Show all these bitches why they cannot hang with her!
Cold weather, knock bitches bundles up
I Got two gatti s, yea I big bundled up
If she get burnt, I send hittas, yes gotti, I buzzled her
If she not dead, I spin back, OCD a Hoe!
Quarter bricks all on my wrist, wrist
So When I startin pitchin, don t miss
A rebel, don t play with ole  miss
Heard that bitch ate it! Got hit with a disc!Listen to the static of the radio
Runnin' red lights on my way back home
This is what you do to me
I'm getting away but I got nowhere to go
Your arms are uninviting and your stare is cold
If this is how it's gonna be
Well I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

Believed in every word that came through your theeth
I though to myself that you meant everything
'Cause that's the way you made it seem
So for now I'm gonna let it go
It isn't worth deeping this hole
Where my heart used to be
So I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

You did'nt really want it
You did'nt really need me
Nurse the wounds but they're still open
From the seams watch it bleed

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

This isn't love but I'll pretendIts a perfect day*
The coolest breeze
Not a cloud in the sky
Casts a shade on me
Colours shining bright
Oh, Its so surreal
And on this perfect day
I got lost
Get me out of this confusion
I'm falling apart
I've got an aching heart
I'm so out of place

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
On a perfect day
I'm drowning in memories
Throw me a lifeline, don't think its my time
And I can hardly breathe
Oh, why did you have to leave
On a perfect day

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
We all know that you're not a lonely heart
We can't stand the laws
You're watching over us, taking care of us
Until we meet again, my friend
You are everything to me and I love you for it
But now you're gone
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on, so carry on, I carry on
It'll be okayEether boy!*
Dj self!
Ooooooh!

Verse:
Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She won 3 rounds, I'mma need a hundred thou
Like china town, bitches better bow down
Oh, you ain't know  bet ya'll bitches know now
Fuck I gotta do to let 'em know that I'm the one 
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the 6 hun the color of bubble gum
I'm with my nigga spits and my nigga, bun crum (waddup!)
Yes, I'm the one, I'm the motherfuckin' one (chyeah!)
Hold more weight than the late big pun (oh!)
Bitches talk slick, but they ain't say nun (no!)
Mad cause I'm bad, 2 sticks in my bun (chyeah!)
Yes, sir, look what i've done
They r-run, run when I come
Bum-stickity-bum, let me tell 'em where I'm from
Queens, little mama, gabbana, some nice pumps (chyeah!)

Freestyle:
Yo, what up  It's Nicki Minaj
Dirty Money, holla at ya girl
Um, shout out to everybody that hit me up for the last come up
Thanks for the love I really do appreciate it, you know what I'm sayin' 
Um, but like, since the last come up niggas was like, coming up to me they was like, "Yo, Nicki you spit crazy"
Get it poppin' like M80 with twin trey 80s
The hood's first lady, you know 
Baby girl of the group, I'm also known as baby girl in the coupe
Never get me confused with baby girl in the hoop
Cuz' Nicki stay fly like that Cash Money do
I'm stuntin' on these hoes like Marilyn Monroe
I gotta esk-curl flow spit slick ya know 
Now I don't just spit raps and chit chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Your girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But Nicki rather chill and stack a mil'
While these hoes stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on the track like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like Quille O' Neal
Gassed ya baby father for the keys to the Esclalade
Not a baby momma put I'm Drama like K Slay
What could I say  It's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down to her cuticles
My people smoke dutches we don't fluck wit bamboo
I'm a winner mami, your careers' a gamble
Old ass broad off track like bad weaves
Nicki stay on the toes on point like ballerines
Lemme remind you I'm getting a tan too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from queens
They say I'm too pretty to be spitting sixteen
I should be on the screen, posing for Maybelline
Or be a baby phat girl getting on my jean
Hood star broad, black barbie doll
Pardon me if the cockiness bothering y'all
I'm just being Nicki Minaj, ya know 
Girl from around way without the L Cool J
While you spit kool-aid, I spit acid out
Doing this since you was Reebok Classic out
And this hoe wanna get at Nick  Why 
Cuz' I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nick so caught up, lil tank top, Ed Hardy zone
Some Dolce Gaban pretty panties on
Like wait til' the summer, catch me up in the hummer
On my way to 55 front, row with the Rucker
Every baller wanna, never give out my number
Only the email, cherrythong.com, holla
Name a girl as real as her, nope not dem
Who's ya best MC's  Nick Fox and KIm
Nick up in the Porsche, box or the Benz nigga

Outro:
Dirty Money, you heard  I do it, I do it for fun like
I mean I just do it cuz' I can like
I only rap because I'm good at it like, really
You know what I'm sayin'  It really was a hobby for a minute
But then you know what I'm sayin'  I was like, "Damn look at the state of hip-hop, like what's goin' on "
Nah but thanks for the love, to everybody you know what I'm sayin' 
Shout out to New York, shout out to everybody who seeing this right now like I'm just on my grind, don't get it twisted
Like it's not a, not even about being cocky, it's just about being real
Like I'm, like I'm good at what I do, so you know what I'm sayin' 
That's why I act the way I act like don't get it twisted like if you see me, holla at me
I'm never too ill to stay, "What up "
Like it's not that serious trust me I know that
But anyway, holla at ya girl, hit me up on MySpace or something
Nicki Minaj, N-I-C-K-I M-I-N-A-J
Ya heard me Watch you're man, you should watch you're mouthDentro al buio del locale
Musica che   sempre uguale
Luci basse che mi danno un po' fastidio
Quelle gambe un po' intriganti
Con le calze trasparenti
Qui si fanno tutte belle ma chiss  per chi
Forse io dovrei andare
Quasi l'ora di dormire
Se mi guarda ancora un po' mi sa che vado l 
S  ma tanto cosa dico
Hai un ragazzo o un marito
Studi o fai un lavoro interessante e unico
Io non voglio pi  sprecare una parola
Perch  il gioco proprio non lo reggo pi 
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola
Sono anni che mi urtano
Mi rovinano da troppo tempo
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andr 
Che non se ne pu  pi 
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Pi  di un freddo vuoto
Quante storie storie vere lui che le offrir  da bere
Come se non si capisse che intenzioni ha
Forse non per amicizia e neanche con dolcezza
Ma poi lei dir  tu che cos'hai capito
Io non voglio pi  sprecare una parola
Perch  il gioco proprio non lo reggo pi 
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola
Sono anni che mi urtano
Mi rovinano da troppo tempo

Che non ne posso pi 
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film

Days go on things will never be the same, anymore
Thoughts of you and the life we never lived
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can t move on, pretending everything s gonna be the way we where
Why can t you hear me, I am inconsolable

I wish I d know you better, time was running out
The quilt I left is more than I can describe
And I keep on calling your name to feel that I m alive
In this empty space, I could never be replaced

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can t move on, pretending everything s gonna be the way we where
Why can t you see me, when I am inconsolable

Everyday I try to carry on, everyday I try to find a meaning
Living in a place where I belong, as cold ice can be
If I could take you back to yesterday
But not for ever gone it s in considerable
It almost that acceptable

Memories frozen in a picture frame
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I can t go on, pretending everything could be the way we where
How can you see me, when I m inconsolable

A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can t go on, pretending everything s gonna be the way we where

Verse 1 :
You let me win
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
& when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weght up
Know when i'm lying
Know when i'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am i trying
No you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at chu
And getting at chu
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at chu
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

Chorus :
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
[x2]

Verse 2:
What are we doing
Could you see through me  
Cause you say nikki
And i say who me  
And you say no you
And i say screw you
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And i start crying
And i start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
Im actually fronting
Im askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Ok your right
Just let it go
Ok you got it
It's in the can
Before i played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

Chorus:
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
[x2]
Stop ohhh..
..stopp ohhh
Would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it
No i can't take it
You see right through me

        [Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel aways
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
More fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yea's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Sveglia alle 7, mi lavo in fretta
Butto gi  un caff , prendo la moto
Faccio mezz'ora di strada ma arrivo
Pi  o meno puntuale in quella scuola

Solite facce, solita gente, solita giornata
Mentre il mio prof mi guarda schifato i capelli
Dice: "Questo   un posto serio!"

Ma io non sono come voi
No, a me non frega niente
Se cammino e mi sento dire

Tagliati i capelli
Che non vanno pi  di moda!
Tagliati i capelli
Se vuoi fare strada!
Tagliati i capelli
Che sembri un barbone, un drogato, insomma
Tagliati i capelli
Come me!

Ore 14, ma dove sono
E cosa sto facendo qui
Sto certamente buttando via tempo
Pensando a tutt'altro che alla scuola
"Guarda che gli anni dei capelloni
Sono gi  passati da un bel pezzo!"

[Full Lyrics on release of song]I thought you'd changed
I thought you'd changed
But I was wrong again
You're still the same
You're still the same
Rumors never end
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you 
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never know
I'll never know
Why you hurt me so
We were cool
We were close
But that's so long ago
You create, you fabricate
The shit that you don't know
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you

And now we can't pretend

[YNGDMND: 1st Verse]
I m the type of guy you don t want to fuck with dawg
Your bitch is my pawg put this shit on pause
Like it cause I m rhyming  every word that s hard
Why complain bout the rhythm when I got these bars (huh)
I m still me doesn t matter what I do or charge
You re still tryin  to find a meaning to your life and scars
I don t fake the message I lay it hard
And I don t regret shit
I came with bars you just keep on hatin 
I m getting far, no lies motherfucker i keep it strong cause I had nobody to teach me all
Still rap because I m still geek n
I ain t the one you want so stop creepin 
Bitch you postin  status bout preachin 
And I don t see nobody healin  somebody so don t talk to me about switchin 
I m just bein  fuckin  real look at my skills
Shout out to the homie lil wayne, that s chill
Pockets lookin  fat but I still need mils
You can t fuck with a nigga that s been too real
I ll hop on any beat produce by ills
Come catch my shade and get the L s
Nigga you worthless keep the fuck off my bills
She tryin  to get me like Tory lanez that s ewww

[Nicki Minaj: 2nd Verse]
I'm in this bitch I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D. Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (my name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander, made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it 
Cash Money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you 
That's a big problem

And you know it's going down, like draino

Ok, he know he's gonna have to step up on a C-note

Sippin' Bahama mamas out of coconut cups
Every hoe on poles like "Nicki ya flows sick"

Bill Gates ain't got enough paper to buy this bitch
You could catch me in the 5 or 6
Slim waist hips banging through the Gucci stitch
Never let these bitches ant me
Always keep the 22 jammy
Tuck 'em in the separate panties (Aye, aye, aye, Oh!)

Hoes be hatin' so I don't sleep too much

Christian Dior too many bitches got Chanel on

In the C-L cause 3 20's is bad for my health
And I don't fuck with scrubs cause they bad for my wealth now (Aye, aye, aye, Oh! Aye, aye, aye, Oh! Aye, aye, aye, Oh!)[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]

Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!

But I don't wanna brag, I Louis Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag, proceeded to shag-shagged him
Thought he was a queen, I dr-dr-dr-dragged him
Dodged to the room and whipped out the Magnum
Slim, trim, also light skin, now, P-P-Peter, put the pipe in

Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was [ ] same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Room, hear it ert-ert when it skrt
26's on the skirt's and a bird with a flirt
You can chirp, I got twerk, I keep work in my birds

Now, come drag your dog out the ring, how you love that 
Young with an attitude, watch how you talk to me
Keep playin' Freddy, boy, I'll leak on your Elm Street
Trouble is what you want, dog, pain is what you don't get

Lil' Twist gonna sell out like it's opening tonight
Going for the fist nigga to write
You need a telescope sight to try to see me, I'm so far gone
Even though I'm going off, kids, I'm so far on

Wrappin' up my lifestyle and I smashed this song, Twizzy

[Transition: T-Streets]
Yeah, next up, we got the best rapstress alive, Nicki Minaj

[Verse 6: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in that cotton-pickin' Bent, put massa on the guts
White on white whips, Kunta Kinte on the clutch
You at the bottom of the pole totem
Like Lamar Odom, I ball scrotum
Flyer than a cricket so they call me "Nicki Jiminy"
And it's going down like Santa in the chim-i-ney
You don't ball, break your baby-back ribs
You need more assist than the handicapped kids
Oh, shit

[Transition: T-Streets]

So fuck with your Magnum on

We hit them and we see them comin' back for more
Back for more

Microwave family in the building, you can't hold us
Me, Tez, and Wayne, we the three new moguls
Buffet around here, y'all boys scrape the plates
And we don't eat up in our whips, but they got paper plates
Soon as we leave the club, damn, where the models go
One word I forgot to say on his album: "Hollygrove!"
This track is the finale, nah, this the genesis

Thousand-dollar sweater on, but I don t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin  death wish
Yeah, tell me, who controls kings 
I don't follow rules, stupid old things

And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings

Blood Gang, motherfucker, da-da-doe in this bitch
Make your girl get Barry Mani-low in this bitch
In the body of the world, money is the blood
And every day, I be back and forward to the blood bank
Ugh, makin' deposits 'til I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga: How 'bout them fucking Saints 
It's tight on our end, call that "Bubba Franks"
Matter-fact, it's too tight add a couple links
I'm the bar s tender, you a woman drink
Yeah, it's Young Money, but the money ain't

You're such a Barbie
Yo, Mariah
I was in the million dollar meetings, he was cheatin 
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away, well the mice will play
Lol smiley face, have a nicer day
'Cause pop pop pop it goes my rubber band
So stop stop stop sniffin' that contraband
'Cause you was penny pinchin'
My account's laced
Attention, about face

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I thought we had something special
And we had something good
But I shoulda had
Another mechanic under my hood
If you see m  walking by ya
Boy don t you even speak
Pr tend you on the sofa
And I m on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy this ain t no promo

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mariah Carey]
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don t keep calling from your
Momma's house

[Chorus 1: Mariah Carey & (Nicki Minaj)]
When I break I break, boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
You ain't never gonna feel
This thing again
You're gonna get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends
I ain't walkin around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby

So look who's cryin' now, boo hoo hoo

No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop
Spittin' it - ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
You'll wonder who I'm messin'
With while you ain't next to me

So pay the consequences
Cause you acting all ignorant

And don't keep callin' from your (yo)
Momma's house (yo yo)

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Stylin' on 'em, big B's, bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Cop those then we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees wit a snot nose
They be like she next, Kawasaki T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left
Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on it
Vroom vroom, with the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave 'em, hit him with that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in the yellow bag

[Bridge: Mariah Carey & (Nicki Minaj)]
And no super glue can fix this shhh
When I break I break I break (break on them girl)
Not even a welder and a builder
Can rebuild this shit when I break I
Break, I break
Not even a nail technician
With a whole lotta
Gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Nicki Minaj]
When I break, boy
(Up out my face boy)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
(No no nooo-oo)
(I break I break I break)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face, up out my face)
Up out my face, I break (up out my face)
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
I will roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
Like straight up and down
I am Nicki Minaj, can't say "ask about me"
Young Money, up out my face
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
(Cause when I break baby baby)
I break, boy

Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face boy, up out my face boy)
Up out my face, I break

Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Tell you nothin')
Up out my face, I break
(Here, I'll tell you something)
(I'm outta here)
