[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls 

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee 
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this 

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now [Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you

You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it

Something like an addict
Got me twisted (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Hypnotized by the way she moves

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk (Oh )

Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve (Oh )
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note (Oh )
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat (IGH! IGH!)
Stay faded like Diddy's hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat (IGH!)
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll (IGH!)

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, uh
In time, ink lines
Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine
Ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East
Beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, beat will get deceased
Every time Beauty on the beat eats

[Break: Justin Bieber & Nicki Minaj]
Body rock (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I wanna feel your body rock (Let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all (All I need is love), I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (Whoa-oh-oh)
It's all 'bout you (All I need is you)
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 2]
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure

[Outro: Acoustic]
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Produced by Skrillex][Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

[Verse]
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words[Verse 1]
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

[Chorus]
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

[Verse 2]
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please 
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

[Chorus]
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

[Bridge]
Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

[Outro (Spoken)]
I don t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that s not who you are. You know you re trying to be the best you can be, but that s all you can do. If you don t give it all you got, you re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That s what happening with me, it s like  God, I m giving it all I ve got, sometimes I m weak and I m going to do it.  And it s like I m not giving myself grace, I m just like understanding that s how it is[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I d never let you go
I could take you places you ain t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

[Pre-Chorus]
I d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I d never let you go, I d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I ma make you shine bright, like you re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

[Pre-Chorus]
I d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I d never let you go, I d never let you go

[Bridge]
So give me a chance,  cause you re all I need, girl
Spend a week with your boy, I ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I d never leave you, girl
I just wanna love and treat you right

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Oh yeah)
Keep you on my arm, girl, you d never be alone (Never be alone)
And I could be a gentleman (A gentleman, ooh), anything you want
If I was your boyfriend (Boyfriend), I d never let you go

Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that

[Chorus]
You are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (Ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (Anyone), not anyone

[Verse 2]
Forever's not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
'Cause every mornin', I'll find you (Oh)
I fear the day that I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
'Cause certain things are out of our control
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that

[Chorus]
You are the only one I'll ever love (Only one, I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (I've ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (It's not anyone, not anyone)

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, woah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (Ever done, oh, yeah)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber (Travis Scott)]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that 
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now 
Live forever young
It s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Alright, yeah, alright)[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company 
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Verse 1]
Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company  (Oh)

Be each other's company
Oh company

[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no

Keep each other company  (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you  Am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling 
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling 

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me 

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you  Am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling 
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling 

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you  Am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling 
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you 
Or am I in love with the feeling [Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me  Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right 
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old 
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(make your mind up)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(right now)
Don't rush, no pressure
(there ain't no pressure)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(no ohh)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(I'll be waiting for you)
Don't rush, no pressure
(baby don't rush)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
(You can take it easy now)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(And I'll still be right here)
Don't rush , no pressure

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure[Verse 1]
Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king babe without a queen 
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king babe without a queen 
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You're all that matters to me[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]

Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

Ayy love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow

I should be playing in the winter snow

When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
(Never say it, never-never say it)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause there's just no turning back (Oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (Oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say never!)
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never (Never, never, never, never)

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & Justin Bieber]
Here we go!
Guess who 
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight  I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go!)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say it, never-never say it)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'till forever make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
And never say never (No, no, never say never)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Ne-Ne-Never say it)
Ne-Never say never
And never say never (Never, never, never)[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever 

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo 
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever 
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever 

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together  ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer 
How many times you gonna try to call my mother  (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone & Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever 

[Verse 3: Clever]
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever 

[Outro: Clever]
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around[Chorus]
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Verse 1]
Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got influence on me, can't comprehend
Oh no, next thing, you're on top of me
Okay with this, I call that a win-win

[Chorus]
So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Post-Chorus]
Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively

Who taught you how to drive stick 
You a fool with it, love the way you fool with it
And the way you motion, motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it

[Chorus]
So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me

Pull me down aggressively

[Bridge]
When I rise up, baby, don't shy up
Open your mind, don't knock it 'til you try it, darlin'
Show off when you come closer
Don't waste no time, love it when I'm in it, shawty

[Chorus]
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me

Hold on tight, that hold on tight

Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go[Verse 1]
Girl you don't know how I feel, how I really feel
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call  Take my call
If I dialed you today, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby

[Chorus]
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker

[Verse 2]
Girl you see me standing here, standing here
Standing in the rain, oh baby
Any chance you could stay right here, yeah yeah
And never go away 

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

[Chorus]
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my  heart's breaking, heartbreaker

[Bridge]
So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name

And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

[Verse 3]
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm, the way that I'm
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love 
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

[Bridge]
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception 
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me 
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me

Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny this energy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits  Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances 
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no

Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together

Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need

[Verse 1]
Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption

[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah

Our love is habitual, yeah

Workin' through the seasons
Never crossed paths 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes we might disagree
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

[Chorus]
I'm goin' through changes

Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

Uh, people change, circumstances change
But God always remains the same[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
9 times out of 10 you a 10
If your schedule open I'll pencil you in
Ight, wiggle it in, get with your friend
Laugh now, cry later, hope you ticklish then
Let's figure it out, I figured it out
Shawty so thick she put a dent in my couch
And dent in my wallet, I'm diggin' her probably
I told her let's kick it, karate
Got a black belt on, Versace
Wanna get my eat on, Hibachi
2 Chainz on with a pinky ring
If I'm your boyfriend, you can have anything
(Anything ) anything, (anything ) everything
(Everything) I can upgrade you to better things (true)
(Hello) you hear that wedding ring 
And if you answer, then we settling

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl
You'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Never let you go

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Youngin' gettin' money, all these honeys say they love me
Buddha belly, how I'm lucky, girls be rubbin' on my tummy
I can be your man, get you everything you need
Have you ever had a Rollie, Stewart Weitzman on your feet 
And you can be my queen, couple thousand on the jeans
Cause I'm down to do some spendin' on the women of my dreams
Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin' baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go
Where I'm tryna take you, we gon' need a boat
Independent raps, yeah my life is like the Beatles though
Invest a big check to make sure you get fresh
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I'd treat you like a princess

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

And I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Never let you go

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
And we can be like Selena and Biebs
Wild and free, a couple disobedient teens
Sneaking out to meet around like 2 o'clock in the eve
Paparazzi ain't a problem, we just hide on the beach
Girl you hotter than me, let's go fly overseas
Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
Cause 7 minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second
Wait a second, smilies in a text
I kinda be interested, I'm lyin' girl I'm obsessed
Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love's a team sport
I'll be your boyfriend, jokes and pillow talk
Lay around in our undies, chill, play Tony Hawk
Dance slow in the dark, come roll with Roth
Cause when that falsetto hits, yall gonna know who to call
So JB

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl
You'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Never let you go

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
So give me a chance, cause you're all I need girl
Spend a week with your boy, I'll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I'd never leave you girl
I just want to love you, and treat you right

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl
You'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go
Never let you go[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Happy birthday

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 3: Nas]
She texts me "How's you love life "
And "How are you ", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer 
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are[Verse 1]
Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
(Woah, woah, woah)
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

[Verse 2]
There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

[Break]

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away 
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there s no one, I can relate to
And know we won t find a love that s so true

[Chorus]
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together

[Verse 2]
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away  Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

[Pre-Chorus]
But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it  We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

[Chorus]
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There s nothing like us, there s nothing like you and me
Together[Verse 1]
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown

[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place

[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt

[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place

[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago

[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A. 
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A. 
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A. 
What's your E.T.A. 

[Verse 2]
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been "
Love me like you don't want it to end

[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A. 
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A. 
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A. 
What's your E.T.A. 

[Outro]
Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
You really got me open (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up  I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
You really got me open (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Travis Scott]
Got me feeling giddy (Ah), like, "La, la, la, la" (Yeah)
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la" (It's lit)
You got the keys to my city (Ooh), like, "La, la, la, la" (Straight up)
Do you second that emotion, baby  (Ah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Mmm, yeah
Out to big boys (It's lit)
Spring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit
Movin' like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)
So you know there's room (Skrrt)
So, baby, please
(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)
Don't like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)
Oh, you sent the jet out for me 
You tryna ball harder than me 

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Did I come 'cross your radar 
Cross your mind now and later 
Do you feel like you know me 
It's just a part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors 
Would you mind the labor  Baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it (Ooh-wee)
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head (Hey, hey, hey)
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it (Ooh-wee)
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )
You really got me open (Do you )
Do you second that emotion  (Do you )

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Got me feeling giddy, like, "La, la, la, la"
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la"
You got the keys to my city, like, "La, la, la, la"
Do you second that emotion, baby [Verse 1]
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

[Chorus]
They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad[Verse 1]
Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night

[Chorus 1]
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

[Verse 2]
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

[Chorus]
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

[Bridge]
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything

[Chorus]
Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright[Verse 1]
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

[Pre-Chorus]
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

[Chorus]
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

[Verse 2]
And I'ma April shower you
Forever if I May
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks
Be your 4th of July
For life
As long as you stand right by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep growing closer
Throughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebrating

[Chorus]
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through

Yeah yeah

(Oh get used to it)[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
Don t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don t wanna be left with the question, why 
Let s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain 

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 2]
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That s what we oughta do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don t ever lie
Giving up is immature, oh
We got so much more to live for, oh
They don t wanna see us together now, oh
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

Yea, yea, yea
Girl you gotta learn to trust me now

Then we could be in love
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, ohh, ohh[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 1]
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don t pay to lie cause I don t wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 2]
I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now (One more time)

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

[Chorus]
And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

[Verse 2]
Look at how it's all unfolding
Yeah, persistence at its finest
Like you wanted in before the door was open
Instead of lettin' what's scripted play out

[Pre-Chorus]
Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

[Chorus]
And we've got the rest (Hey, hey)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest (Oh-ooh)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
Yeah, we've got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But did you know that I loved you 
Or were you not aware 
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly 
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry 
Cause I know that a piece of you s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Bridge]
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can t fly unless you let yourself fall

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love  (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared)
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fall[Intro]
What do you mean it's not like that 
Oh, you're sorry 
Well, where are you now that I need you 
But girl, let me tell you something

[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling

[Verse 1]
Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much

[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame

[Verse 2]
Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, it s really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross 

[Chorus]
We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with me[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib 
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like  (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like 
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up  (Breast)
How you so hot and cute  (How )
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Verse 1]
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular

If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion

If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean

[Vamp]
See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition[Intro]
So girl
You just be honest with me
I know we can make this work
I love you
I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe

[Verse 1]
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it, that commitment
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than ambition

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Bridge]
If I came to your crib, would you open the door 
I don't wanna go down that road, no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you[Verse 1: Cody Simpson]
I don't work harder when it's easy

Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Cody Simpson]
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends

You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until it s done
I don t need to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I'm on one
You know I'm on one, yeah
I said I'm on one
You know, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink, it could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that ish, money that we got, never get that ish
Cause I'm on one, yeah
You know I'm one one, yeah yeah

You know what I like
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women
I don't, I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
You're the only one
I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women

(Oh yeah, let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah)

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show 
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah

Nothin' like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they re off me and let it sink in
Hear me talkin', don't ignore me

Been thinkin  'bout you, can't get this vision out my head

Lately, that's been more than often, baby, what is this 
It's like, do you even miss me 
Feelin' less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, trippin' in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

[Chorus]
Are you available (Yeah-yeah) now 
Oh, here I am, (Yeah-yeah) oh, here I am

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)[Verse 1]
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

My heart is blind but I don't care
Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold ya near
I never want to let ya go, oh

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me[Intro]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time

[Verse 1]
I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

[Verse 2]
When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah

[Chorus]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)
I appreciate you (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
God bless your maker, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)
Look at this love[Intro: Quavo & Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey where the party at  Let's go, let's ride, Let's roll
Yeah, everywhere I go them girls follow, na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Hey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name  Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her  Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when you re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more 
You need to know that I ain't playin'
Baby what are we waitin' for 

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love

I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"

[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name  Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her  Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
There's no sophistication in my lack of patience
I'm just wishing you were better at communication
As I sit here steady waiting
Wishing that you would call my name in

[Pre-Chorus: (Selena Gomez) & Justin Bieber]
(Wishing I was better with the distance)
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
What should I do  Should I go 
Who do I talk to  Nobody knows
Who knows the answer to all of my questions 
When will I get over this, over this 

[Pre-Chorus: (Selena Gomez) & Justin Bieber]
(Wishing I was better with the distance)
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all that love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', oh, she was wrong

[Chorus]
Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn t give it to her, I'm talking to you

[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that 
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that 
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

[Verse 2]
Now she's in the magazines
On TV making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn t give it to her, I'm talking to you

You do this, you prove this
Your foolness, seduces

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

[Verse]
I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]
And if I could
Forget about the way you loved me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

[Bridge]
Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
That's a part of living, woah
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah

[Outro]
If only I could hit the ground
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground[Chorus]
No I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing baby

[Verse 1]
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah

[Chorus]
But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like woah
It was a bad day, it was a bad day[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe 
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe 
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else  If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else  If you wanna be my baby

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe 
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Is this what you want  The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real  Look, tell me, is it real 
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up 
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe 
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe 
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Justin Bieber
Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah you say I'm crazy  Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses

Wait...I'm not done

[Verse 2]
I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you 
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that "It's not mine"
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry[Intro: Justin Bieber]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it 
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee 
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Chorus 1: Justin Bieber (J Balvin)]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aqu  extra  ndote
Okay, tu por mi morias ma'

Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte

[Pre-Chorus 2: J Balvin]
Solo espero que me perdones
Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tu y yo no podemos estar
Olvida todo, no voy a fallar

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]

Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up ), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it[Verse 1]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now
To accept all responsibility

[Pre-Chorus]
I go out of my way to live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Verse 2]
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing

[Pre-Chorus]
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Outro]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now[Intro]
Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline

[Verse 1]
Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me  I just wanna know
How come you act so different  Just talk to me I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

[Chorus]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 

[Verse 2]
Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing 
She said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now

[Pre-Chorus]
I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

[Chorus]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline

Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline 
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline [Verse 1]
Where are you now when I need you the most 
Why don't you take my hand 
I want to be close
Help me when I am down, lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Where are you now 

[Verse 2]
Where are you now now that I'm half grown 
Why are we far apart 
I feel so alone
Where are you now when nothing's going right 
Where are you now 
I can't see the light

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

[Bridge]
I need you to need me
Can't you see me 
How could you leave me 
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me, hold me, and love me now
Where are you now 
Oh, where are you now 

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Oh, where are you now 

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah[Verse 1]
I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

[Chorus]
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

[Verse 2]
Right leg crossed while you're smokin' a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody takin' pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines 
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

[Chorus]
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

[Verse 1]
Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby 
Could you do that to me, yeah 
Would you lie to me, baby 
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy 
Leave my heart still at the door 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is...

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Interlude]
Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)
But it sure is worth a try
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby 
If this is a lesson, then baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you

On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here

Love is in the air
Candles all around us
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change

[Chorus]
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Babe, you are the reason to breathe
And babe, you know you're all that I need
Remember when you took my hand
And ran away (it was just us two babe)
And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes

Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me  Does he love you the way I can 
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me  Cause baby I didn't

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me

[Verse 2]
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies  What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working because you know that

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me

This is so wrong, I can't go on

It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart

That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me

Come here
I don't know what happened

[Verse 1]
Where did they go 
Nights like this don t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control  (Slow it down)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

[Verse 2]
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah (But I can't help but feel like)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

[Chorus]
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down[Intro: Raekwon]
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up  Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain 
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going  That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do 
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love 
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin' "
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love 
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face 
Oh why, I must be blind 
How did I let you get away 
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this (bitch), the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that  Feel me 
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love 
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love 
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love[Intro]
Believe, believe, believe, believe

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I got here, uh
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

[Chorus]
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe 
Believe

[Verse 2]
There were days when I was just broken
You know, there were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from folding

[Pre-Chorus]
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

[Chorus]
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe 
Believe

[Bridge]
Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Wouldn't know, how it feels, to touch the sky
If you didn't believe, believe, believe

[Pre-Chorus]
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

[Chorus]
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe 
Believe

[Outro]
Where would I be if you, yeah, if you didn't believe 
Wouldn't know how it feels to touch the sky, yeah
If you didn't believe, believe, believe
Where would I be if you didn't believe [Verse 1]
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, "It's time to sink or swim,"
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody

[Verse 2]
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love

I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Bridge]
And you can have it all
Anything you want, I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find
Cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh oh, find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Outro]
I need somebody, I need somebody, I need somebody to love
Is she out there  Is she out there 
Is she out there  Is she out there 
I just need somebody to love[Verse 1: Jessica Jarrell]
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Jarrell]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
Whoa

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never understood you when you'd say, oh
You wanted me to meet you halfway, woah
I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change, cause now I see, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya

So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell]
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do  Cause I still love you
And you're the only one who can save me
Woah, woah, woah

Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it
Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

[Verse 3]
Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the Benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're trying to snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues 
And if you had a choice I know what'd you choose
You'd choose me, right 

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be 
Could this be happening to me, yeah 
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by 
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do 

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility 
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Verse 2]
In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility 
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Bridge]
Should I tell her how I really feel 
Should I move in close or just be still 
How will I know 
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change 
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh 

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility 
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Outro]
Catching feelings, catching feelings[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you 
Need you the most

[Verse 1]
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying 
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now that I need you 
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you 
Need you the most

[Verse 2]
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now 
Where are you now that I need you 
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you 
I need you the most[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Ever since I met you babe I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have, she's priceless for real oh
You don't ever have to do a thing but give me all your love and affection, oh
You have something going for yourself, that's the type of girl for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

[Chorus]
Hey girl, you're something out a magazine
You're something on a movie screen
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Hey girl, you're something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say

[Verse 2]
Ever since you looked into my eyes nothing seems to phase me, oh
There's no one who ever satisfied, stolen love can make me, oh
Fell the way you do, its something in the way you do
The way you move your body girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

[Chorus]
Hey girl, you're something out a magazine

Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say

[Bridge]
Ever since I met you baby I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have, she's priceless for real oh
You don't ever have to do a thing but give me all your love and affection, oh
You have something going for yourself, that's the type of girl for me

Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong

Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say[Verse 1]
They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that it's meant to be
Cause baby, when you're with me

[Chorus]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Verse 2]
I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here 
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

[Chorus]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Breakdown]
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so

[Bridge]
Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl, I'm here
If you didn't know, this is love

[Chorus - Shortened]
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

[Outro]
So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here, right here (I'll never let you go)
Don't shed a tear
Whenever you need me, I'll be here (I'll never let you go)

And I pray

[Verse 1]
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me
How I can make a change 

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

[Verse 2]
I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner cause some of my dinner
Is still there on my plate 
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference and it's starting today

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me
How I can make a change 

[Chorus]

I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

[Bridge]
I pray for the brokenhearted, I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing, I pray for all the souls in need
I pray, can you give 'em one today 
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change 

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

[Verse 2]
And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow 
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears 
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

[Bridge]
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go 
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

[Outro]
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how[Verse 1]
Ripped denim, baby, how'd you fit 'em 
Baby, dipped in venom, baby, killin' 'em, killin' 'em, baby
Always try long, but you better than them, baby
Rightin' all my wrongs for you with precision, baby

I gotta draw the line
I cannot waste this time
Now that I made your mind
I gotta make sure you're always mine, mm

You know you're my baby, baby
Mam , milk with the honey
Mean it when I say it, don't be lookin' at me funny
Scared 'cause you love me, care 'cause you trust me
Never ever break that baby, trust me: you can trust me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know how to draw the line
I cannot waste no time
Now that I made your mind (Oh, yeah)
I gotta make sure you're always mine (Oh, yeah)

Hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get any less than you should

[Chorus]
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile, oh
'Cause whenever you smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Your lip's my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say, hey
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
When you smile, I smile
Oh woah
You smile, I smile, hey

[Verse 3]
Baby, take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby

Baby, you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
'Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish cause it's my command, hey hey hey

[Chorus]
You smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh

[Outro]
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile[Intro]
With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

[Verse 1]
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew 
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Verse 2]
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew 
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge]
See like just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

[Breakdown]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you[Verse 1]
She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Hate it when we're miles apart

Gonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her
She can't hide away, cause the world knows who we are

Now she's giving ultimatums
She don't like this life
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up, won't think twice
I can't do that

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for

Damn, that's why I love her

[Chorus]
She don't like the lights, whoah

Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

[Bridge]
How can I choose between the two, when all the lights are all I know 
I wish she could see how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life without her by my side
Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know whoah, she don't know whoah

[Outro]
She don't like the lights
The lights

She don't like the lights whoah
She don't like the lights, no
She don't like the lights[Verse 1]

The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this, girl
What'd you do to me 

[Pre-Chorus]
You're who I'm thinking of

So girl, let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel

There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, I'm starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
You say that no matter what, you're watching over me
And know when I first touched your lips
Your energy is enough to suffice
Only angels speak like this

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watching over me[Intro]

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

[Verse 1]
I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

I would build the love of river wide so that it never runs dry, yeah
Any time you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right, I just can't read your mind, no

[Pre-Chorus]

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day

Look at all the choices, the choices in this world
World spreading no freedom, freedom for the boys and the girls
But the boys and the girls they don t know, what love is like
Love is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite

[Pre-Chorus]
So can we go 
No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine

[Chorus x2]
Cause this is my time
And I won t waste it
Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
Look at all the places, places that I've been
It doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength
And when it goes down and it s all said and done
You gotta stand up so there s no need to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And now that I've made it
I won t look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Look at all the people standing outside
So dedicated
Your love doesn't go unrecognised
Your love doesn't go unrecognised[Hook: Usher]
It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle

If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me

Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man

If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime[Verse 1]
You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going, I swear, nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why 
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young 
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed 
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Bridge]
Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)
(Just remember) You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (Bigger)
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small (so small) from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger (Our love's bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger) and you're bigger (you're bigger), hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger [ ] and you're bigger, woah[Intro]
As long as you love me, yeah, oh, yeah

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning

[Pre-Chorus]
But hey now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl

Don't stress and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
But just take my hand

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 3]
I don't know if this makes sense but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there, girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without U
Now we on top of the world, that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Now we stepping out like oh God, cameras point and shoot
Ask me "What's my best side " I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true, but I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, everything I need
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me, you love, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me yeah, yeah[Verse 1]

You know the truth, babe

Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back 
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that I loved you  Or were you not aware 
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly 
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Bridge]
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself

[Chorus]
Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby[Letra de "La Bomba" ft. J Balvin]

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]

You got me wrapped around your finger
And I wanna see your body next to mine to mine, to mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know if you can do the following
If you can't, then please don't follow me

You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one
(I, I just need a new one, I, I just need that brand new one, yeah)

[Verse]
They just wanna play with me, they just wanna play with me
Just got back from the Middle East
Maybe just a little cheese, still wanna play with me 
Back to the crib for two minutes, I got something to do
Yeah, you get it
Yeah I copped something new, a new get-up
Yeah, phone coming through, you keep your head up
Gotta have all the new kicks, better have all the new tricks
And my bank go shit, gotta have all the new whips
Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick
I never had a problem with a money clip
Paper always glazed like a honey dip
I was always raised like "Honey, quit"

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you ain't really knew
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that this is what I found
And everyone of y'all are just like me, yeah
It's too bad that you can't see that you've got it

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
And you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, she's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
And you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody
You got it bad

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ho, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm, I'm taken by the thought of this

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Chorus]
So then it's all because of you
Said it's all because of you
Said it's all because
Never get enough

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced

Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working cause you know that

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me

I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield, this pain in my heart, ooh

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me

It's time to realize it's time to call me young sire
You're the seller, I'm the buyer
You're the teller, and I'm higher
I'm higher than the highest point and, yes, I'm flyer
And I'm wired to the game
Stay dry when it rains
I'm tired of the fame, are you proud of the pain 
Yes, we're the same, yes I'm insane
And my mane hangs down, I'm a puppet got strings
I murdered that man, OK

Shawty Mane, Shawty Mane
What you doin' Shawty Mane 
Haha I'm Justin Bieber
You guys might know me, uh as the guy that sings Baby
You know uh I'm a singer

Patiently waiting  cause I know that soon or later
You'll be ready to understand who I am
Patiently waiting  cause I know it will be, know it will be okay
But I'm still at it
Lights, camera, action
I m always keeping busy, babe
And I do it cause I have too, I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
And all the things you put me through
Got no time to waste (Waste)
I guess we really needed space (Space)

I just wanna know if you want to
Try and understand  cause I want you

I don t want to be with nobody else

And all the times you tried to stop me
Uhum, it ain t working

Yeah, JB, yeah, woah, no no

[Verse 1]
Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

[Pre-Chorus]
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

[Chorus]
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell 
Tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell 
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody 
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell 

[Verse 2]
It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell 
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell 
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell 
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies, don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what I give

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Kiss and tell, whoa oh, I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell, oh no no no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell, that's not me[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want a better life, I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody is living life with someone they can't hold
It must be hard to sleep at night, believe me girl, I know

[Chorus]
I wanna be your lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea

You say you want a better life, I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody is living life with someone they can't hold
It must be hard to sleep at night, believe me girl, I know

[Chorus]
I wanna be the lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea
You'll always have a home here with me
I wanna be

JB, Jaden Smith, let's go

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don t shed tears, girl, they bawl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Got me thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still  Do ya, do ya 
Do you not think so far ahead 
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead 
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I be thinking 'bout you, and you know I do
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl, so are you
Man I heard some things but I don't know what's true
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you, but a man will show it
That's why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But let's just have some fun girl, as long as you're here
Cause when you get up on that plane, you'll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, it's wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared  Cause that's what they say
And everyday that I don't see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking I'm crazy
But they don't know that I think about you daily cause I be

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no

Do you not think so far ahead 
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead 
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

Baby I could pick you up in the Rolls Royce
Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
Every time that I'm away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that'll never stop
They say it's true love, well is love true 
Yeah I think it's love, that's why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I don't think you are so fly
And I know why ain't no guy gon' treat you like I
Wanna, gonna be the man that treats you right, be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right, let's go into the night

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no

Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Through the storm and through the clouds, bumps on the road and upside down
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night, don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright

[Verse 2]
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, oh I love you

[Chorus]
And everything's going to be alright
Be alright, yeah yeah

Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Oh, when you used to worry about the little things
Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing

Babe, I'll take control
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go
And I got your back, babe, and I won't let you go
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 1]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 2]
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

[Chorus]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Outro]
Only intentions
That's all I plan to do[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the beginning it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Ski Mask the Slump God]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God & Justin Bieber]
Huh, well okay
Told her that it's going down like that lace (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh)
Before I eat her for dinner I say grace
Kickin' it with her, I resemble a sensei
Mistakes that I've made
Made my bed, I lay my head in it (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh)
So save your breath, no need to explainin' it
Because I need that
Old love like the Adam and Eve
Like something before B.C
Baby, we should have a toast to us
Yes, the both of us, because our love is the bees knees
Without you it's insanity, we scream profanity
But Justin told me, "Keep it PG"
I see you, me on my BB
Simons belt shinin' on 'em down to Waikiki (Okay)
Tuesday, huh, it feel like Friday when you met me, huh
We was bumping Kodak on the interstate, huh
You can tell me and her have exquisite taste, huh
That's my little baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Does he love you the way I can 
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me 
Cause, baby, I didn't

[Chorus: Justin Bieber With Rascal Flatts]

That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on 'til you believe that that should be me
That should be me

[Verse 2: Rascal Flatts & Justin Bieber]
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies 
What you doing to me 
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working cause you know that...

That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on 'til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby
Oh, that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me[Intro]

But no more, if you let me inside of your world there'll be the one less lonely girl

How many dinner dates, set dinner plates and he didn't even touch his food 
How many torn photographs are you taping back  Tell me that, couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces, now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Bridge]
I can fix up your broken heart, I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe, I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall with me, her hearts locked and know what, I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girlNothing nothing nothing nothing

She dances in these sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime

"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just won't appreciate
And though she takes, her love in vain
Though she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber and Michael Jackson]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own (Her own)
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

A fire that's deep inside me

Waiting to be set free

Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me

I'm gonna rise above, show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody, I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around, woah
This world can make you feel small, woah
They will not keep me down, woah
I was born to stand tall

But I still see you clear

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I love you more than this 
Tell me the way and I can fix it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
No more lonely nights, no more city lights
And when I'm feeling in the worst way, you know how to bring me back baby
Light shines through the crowd now, darkest days in the past nights
You don t know what you do to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus][Intro]
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio 

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio 

[Bridge]
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Outro]
Yeah yeah[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You asked me to come over (over)
You said that you would be alone (alone)
And when I got there for you
Someone was in your room
You gotta play these games with me
And all I could do is slam the door
Can't stand you anymore (you're breaking me down, down)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
But was it worth it  (woah)
To lose me forever
Did I deserve it  (Maybe, maybe)
I guess it s making me better, making me better

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

[Verse 3: Euro]
Euro
Let's play, I trust you and you trust me (okay, go)
Anything you wanna say to me
Any song you wanna play for me, play slow
I take my time to listen, don't waste your time and listen
'Cause they say love will kill you, let me say my dying wishes
Ain't this world is so called riskers 
Girl it's your call to risk it
You called I had to pick up to make up for all my misses
But when we're together, you act like a different artist
So I painted this to show you I'm better at being heartless, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You know exactly what to do to hurt me
It's working, it's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)

You know I got you until the whole world ends
You know I got you, won't you come and be my girlfriend 
Cause you're scared to fall, but you won't spread your wings
You know it's hard to fly when you don't try new things
And I'mma be the one to make you smile for a minute
Put your head down, lick it down for a minute
Baby, maybe this sounds crazy
Thinking about you lately

Il y a des mots qu'aujourd'hui on se dit mais qui nous font du tort
Et qui ne valent rien quand on les retient et  a rien que pour y croire encore
Tu gardes les mots qui restent intacts et les larmes qui coulent sur ton corps
Mais si je reste avec toi, there'll be the one less lonely girl

To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme

Girl, it's almost a new year, and it's too clear
Me you and a root bear, float in my house
'Bout to count down 'cause we got a whole crew here
Yo, they 'bout to party hardy, looking for a hottie with a nice body
Oh, y'all have fun with that
And we don't need the mistletoe, we was under that

You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're drivin' here, through the winter snow

Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby, think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & with The Band Perry]
Pacing down the hallway, tryna fight the urge to call

[Verse]
Took out the lambo
Man, this thing got handles
One hand on the booty, this a damn scandal
Ready for it like you panhandle
Pants saggin', I'm a damn vandal
Like Van Damme do it
Took a couple years off, shed a couple tears, dog, messed up here and there
No fear here, dog, got a wife, living life, living right, yeah, it's tight
Gluten free, look at me, would'a thought I'd be nice
When I rap, I will slap on the beat
I attack with the heat, no strap
I defeat, no cap
Yeah, my style is impeccable, my wife, yeah, I put her on a pedestal
Yeah, my life is like the movie The Incredibles
They put me on some medicine
Never thought that my depression would depend on it, I've been sending it
Going hard running on adrenaline
Been a victim of the system, I'm a Christian with a vision, I'm a gentleman

[Chorus]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
Why let it get to me when we don't even know each other, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
I don't even let it get to me, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to 'em
Yeah they tryna get at me yeah but I ain't gonna feed into it
Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can t take what s mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Hoping you would change me, hoping you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good, they try to break me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Blake Kelly]
Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me  How you gon' break me  I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy 
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it

[Chorus][Verse 1]
You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

[Chorus]
So when you re lost and you re tired
When you re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you

[Verse 2]
It was  94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

[Chorus]
So when you re lost and you re tired
When you re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you

[Bridge]
I don t know what I d if you left me
(So please don t go away)
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today

[Chorus]
So when you re lost and you re tired
When you re broken in two
Let my love take you higher (you higher)
'Cause I, I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (to you, to you, to you)
I still turn to you (I still turn to you)

Showing up late, dragging along
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it

[Verse 1]
Another jet, another day in the sky
Fly in another direction from you
Wish I could FedEx my heart

More than likely from across town
Double shame on me
Double shame, oh

So he'll never get anxious"
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if you're too high maintenance
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if I'm just too famous (Uh)
Tryna shake the negative energy
I'm with the karma coming right back on me
In a moment I'm flying
Metaphorically, it seems like Heaven

[Chorus]
No sleep at all, runnin' a lie (Runnin' a lie)
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time (Guess time is up)

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

[Verse 2]
Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me

Going nowhere so I'm trying again

Yes you have call so, yes, here I am
Cold no sweater
Bold no letter

My role go-getter
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes

The goal I'mma set is a whole lot better
When the storm from Jehovah comes
I'm gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart
I'mma roll ah were never be apart
But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder 
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter
Yeah, a straight gunner, but it feels strange
Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute 
Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
Life is so short, but we just take it for granted
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
Flying so high and, yes, I just landed
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
I'm growing up quick like a grown man is
I'mma be set so will my great grand kids
Swag!!!!![Verse 1: Justin Bieber]

Oh don t you look back after you conquer the sky

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Never wanna run away, never let your work be in vain

Staying determined, wasn t easy at times
Never stopping your focus, till all fell in line

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Never did I run away, never let my work be in vain

And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away (Oh, oh)
Oh, wash away

[Verse 2]
21 years ago, it's never ever been the same
And all my life I never wanted to play the game
I'm not the same as Michael even though the hall of fame
I'm all hall of faith
Put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things I learned along the way
Figured out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me...

[Chorus]
Open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away (Oh, oh)
Oh, wash away[Verse 1]
It's like every time you fall
No one's gonna lend you a helping hand, oh
Wondering will you spend your life facing four walls
Like standing in quicksand, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong
I know what you can be cause underneath
You've had wings all along

[Chorus]
And you've been travelling the same road for a long time
Feels like you're burning rubber going nowhere fast
I mean to tell you there's no limit to what you can do
You just gotta believe[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Never say never, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & Justin Bieber]
Here we go, guess who 
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight  I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
Never say never, never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never, never say never (never say it)
And never say never
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never
And never say never[Intro]
I think I found my girl, if it s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it s you then speak to me

[Verse 1]
Girl it s getting late, the sun's going down
And it s about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just want to say
That you stay on my mind each and every day
I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when it s building inside, then I can t pretend
No I don t want to fight it, I don t want to hide the way I feel
So I guess it s time for me to say

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

[Chorus]
Cause on nights like this
It s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever

[Verse 2]
Don t know if it's love, it's too early to say
But if it s something like it, I just want it to remain
Don t know if you re the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it s a hint of what s to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward
But I think it s best for you to know

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

[Chorus]
Cause on nights like this

When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean 
Oh, what do you mean 
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean 
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean 
Better make up your mind, what do you mean 

[Verse 1]
You re so indecisive, what I m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start 

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you re down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know 

[Chorus]
What do you mean 
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no

You re overprotective when I m leaving
Tryna compromise but I can t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night

Don't be so selfish baby, yeah
What do you mean 
Oh, what do you mean now  Hey-ey
Oh, oh tudurudururu
Oh, oh, hey, yeah yeah
What do you mean [Verse 1]
I never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh

[Verse 2]
And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow 
You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears 
Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here

[Pre-Chorus]
So we'll fight through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh

[Bridge]
We fell so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go 
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth

[Outro]
I never thought that it'd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
This is the time a year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it, get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight when you open your eyes
When the lights go bright, girl, I'll be right there

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby, you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest, girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like now I know that it's Christmas time

[Verse 2: Boyz II Men]
You got on my favourite dress
You're looking, looking, looking good
Snow fallin' on your hair, and I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby, you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest now

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me like, now I know that it's Christmas time

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Boyz II Men]
I'll deck your heart with boughs of holly (Boughs of holly)

Baby, 'cause you're the reason to be, jolly (You're the reason)
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la (Baby girl)

Ooh-ahh, yeah[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Rest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like you

[Verse: Poo Bear]
See my arms, were made to wrap around you
My heart, was made to beat for you
This love was made to adore you in every way
All of my time is made to spend on you
Life, gotta live for you
Wanna post it on a billboard till you know the world is yours
That's for sure

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Rest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like you[Intro]
What  Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand

[Verse 1]
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school 
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy

[Chorus]
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

[Verse 2]
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you re not there, woah 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain

[Chorus][Chorus x2]
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
I'm all about that, all about that bass
I'm all about that, all about that bass
I'm all about that bass, no treble
We gon' take it to a whole 'nother level, bass
We know that shit ain't real, we know that shit ain't real
We know that shit ain't real, we know it's photoshopped
We know that shit ain't real, we know that shit ain't real
We know that shit ain't real, we know it's

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Bass[Verse 1]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew 
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Verse 2]
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew 
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge]
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with youOhh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah

(Verse 1)
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You are my love, You are my heart
And we will never ever-ever be apart
Are we an item. Girl quit playing
"We're just friends"
What are you sayin 
Said theres another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

(Chorus)
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

(Verse 2)
For you, I would have done what ever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, ill buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around

(Chorus)
And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh

You make me lose my patience (yeah)
No I can't stand the wait, I need you asap (asap)
When you come around I ain't never going 'bout my way (my way)
I hope you understand that (yeah)
You bring out the best and leave the negative

Who you love is actually irrelevant
And you should be prescribed for every case

Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)

So effortlessly, you're amazing
Conversations so engaging (go on)
Talented, so entertaining
You win me over and over again, yeah

[Chorus]
My antidepressant baby, (too slow , oh woah, hey hey)

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voic s singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck th  halls with boughs of holly!"

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way, way[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2: Drewsome]
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls 

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Like words in a book but they don't have an ending
Standing impatient, all the walls are spinning
Rush to a plane to find it's been delayed
Guess I'll hurry up and wait

Stuck in the sands, still looking for an ocean
Rain on my face, but ain't no cloud today
Down on my knees to pray, it turns to hoping
So desperate in the worst way

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I ll hurry up and wait

Teenage girls is what I really like
And I'm still a young boy but I'm still so fly

Yeah, you see my smile caught it on the cam-er-a
Drink a Red Bull grew wings see the stamina
Shout out to my boys, yeah, they're up there in Canada
I used to live there 'til I moved to Atlanta
Where the girls are so hot, here the girls are fine too
Catching Bieber fever, forget the swine flu

Can I be the one to take you round town 
Be the one to call when you're feeling so down 
I could be your man
You could be my crown

I'm J. Bieber, first name last name!
J. Bieber, check it on the past lane!
J. Bieber, im always in the fast lane!

So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry  bout the security
It s only for your safety
Cause baby I ll be pimpin 
Holler if you see me
I m probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you re greedy
 Cause you ll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki

How we the illest and the youngest 
I really don t know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it s really early
But I don t know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds

Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn t see you
It s hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin  I m the funnest
All I m hearing is claps
Though I don t know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I ll get you so excited
Tell me what you want

To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Oh jeez
Girl you got me and you gon  make me work
Cause it s usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it s not your body
But trust me that s a plus
Cause you re hotter than wasabi
And I m diggin  on your kicks
Jokers talking  bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can t drive it
It s only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I m on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club 
 Cause I tried to get in but I ain t reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn t so I m
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin

Oh damn, I'm coming in, save that[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Verse 2]
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
Shine on me tomorrow: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be, let it be[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I ll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin  to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave m  life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold m , hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Yes, oh God)
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can t wait another second
 Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don t go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don t go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Chance the Rapper)]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Feels so) Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Feels so)[Intro]
Ride, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride

[Verse 1]
When I wake up, I first think of you
I really like you and I hope you like me too
The sky's the limit for me and you
I could be your queen, but you could be my boo

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you

[Chorus]
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
I just want to ride with you

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm with you, you make me feel special
And all my problems, they go right out the door
I love it when you call me baby, baby
It's you I adore, adore

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you

[Verse 1: R. City]
You ain't been answering the phone
And I know you seeing me calling
You say it's over, we're done
Tired of giving me warning
Girls sliding in my DMs
Me said there no time to meet them
Telling you that we just friends
But flying them out on the weekend

[Pre-Chorus: R. City]
I got a weakness for sweetness and everyone knows
I'm going crazy for ladies who dress in tight clothes
I know you're tired of hearing me apologize
And I can see that you're ready to tell me goodbye

[Chorus 1: Justin Bieber & (R. City)]

Girl, you be tripping, you're too insecure
Dem other girl way too bad to ignore
But me only looking at what's in them stores

[Pre-Chorus: R. City]

[Outro: R. City]
Take something and wave it
Take something and wave itAs a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance

Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended

I'm very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again

Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always what's right

Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once again.... I'm sorry[Chorus]
You still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh no

[Verse]
If I bought you a beach house, you would ask for the ocean
If I take you [ ] you would want to go higher, baby
And first I thought that you needed, acts of service babe
And now I think different, now I think different, oh

[Chorus]
You still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh no
You still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh no[Verse 1]
Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Verse 2]
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here, here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now

And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again, I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there 
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a young un you re looks but so precious
But now you re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn t never figure out
How to love
How to love

[Verse 2]
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there 
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Bridge]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn t your fault
Wasn t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there 
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Outro]
I just want you to knowSnippet
[Verse  ]
Said you're amazing
She said you must be crazy
I said "no I'm not, well, a little maybe"
And I don't talk a lot
But when I do I mean it
And I swear I know an angel
Baby when I see you
I know I do have issues
But ain't got to do with you
Not gonna lie girl I miss you
No, it ain't superficial
We spent beautiful moments
And some beautiful dream
But ain't nothing more beautiful
Than you were next to me
And I got a couple things[Intro]

Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you

Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin  till I met Jesus
And ain t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe  em
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em

How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
How many crosses on my neck, let me check

Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Go)

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Holy cross, let me shake the demons off (Holy)
He lost that prize in the sauce (Holy)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Ties)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Yeah)

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever 

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo 
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever 
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever 
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever

Let me start off with the old school flow

[Verse 1]
Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that 
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune 
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda
To know that I'm the ruler a
And I'm, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris Bueller

Loving you is my mission
I know I can make a difference, woah
I got responsibilities
And I'm never gonna leave (Uh)
Loving you is my mission
My one and only mission
I see you and only you
And I'll prove it now
Tunnel vision's got me focused on you
I'm aware of your needs and I'll hold you down
I'll even scratch that little part on your neck, I know you like that
Over and over again

        [Verse 1]
Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Verse 2]
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them

When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

        [Verse 1]
You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Bridge]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it 

[Chorus]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone 
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

[Verse 2]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

[Bridge]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it 

[Chorus]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone

Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot

Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear [ ] was

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Verse 2]
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down 
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Bridge]
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean 

[Beat Drop]

[Chorus]
Ooh, when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean 
Hey, when you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean 

[Bridge]
Ooh, what do you mean 
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean 
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean 
Better make up your mind
What do you mean With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

[Tyga]
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you. I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say its puppy
Love ain't lust, It's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now its sunny
Loving you, it was us against the World
You my favourite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

[Justin Bieber]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do
We do

You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care
I got you baby

See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
Cuz ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeahhhh

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah

        [Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself[Nicki Minaj:]

Everybody s looking for you
But it hurts when he finally finds you
Still we hold on
I know you are no good for me
Try to believe in something, holding on to nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that s the reason

[Chorus]
You re overrated, overrated, overrated
You re overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that s the reason
You re overrated

[Verse 2]
Everybody always crying over you
 Cause they fell so hard for you
Tryna move on, forget that you re broken-hearted
Lying to yourself, holding on to nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that s the reason

You re overrated, overrated, overrated
You re overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that s the reason
You re overrated

        Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low 
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you

I will still be patient with you

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you

I will still be patient with you

Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

As long as you love me
As long as you love me

[Verse 1]
I'm under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me

[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for the change girl
You can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

[Bridge]
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me

As long as you love, love me, love me

[Big Sean]
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it
I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow (Oh God)
Camera's pointed shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

[Chorus]
As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me

        [Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
But I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and  fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Verse 2]
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
When you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
But I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself


[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down these walls 

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Outro]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and [fuck] yourself[Verse 1]
It's easy to get frustrated
When you got no answers
It's easy to get overwhelmed
Make you wanna put the blame on somebody else
I can sympathize with ya
Yeah, I will always ride with ya
I'll be the one to cry with ya

[Chorus]
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
Lo-onely, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely

[Verse 2]
I can see you're in the head of gear
No, I can't stand to see you when you're strugglin'
Yeah, you need a little motivation
Remember, life is a celebration
Bad thoughts that cross for no perspective
And Lord knows I need some good direction
Maybe this time is of the essence

[Chorus]
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
Lo-onely, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonelyIf I was your boyfriend, I d never let you go

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances 
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances


[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]

How 'bout reapin' all the benefits  Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances 
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get meSitting here just thinking about nothing
Trying to gather my thoughts
Over and over I'm thinking about all we have lost

All about you, you
It s all about you, you
All about you, you
It s not about me, yeah
It s all about you

It's not about what I've done
It s all about what you did
All about what did to me
You did for me
You gave me life and life abundantly,
Took all my struggles for more than me
That's what you did
I'm amazed by you

It's not about my past, It's not my future
It's about the present, It's right nowI miss you

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and we're upside down
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room..
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I
Oh I
(Oh I)
Love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through.. anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long lights, and the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long lights, and the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright[Verse 1]
Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king bed without a queen 
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king bed without a queen 
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

JB, JT
JB, JT
Aye girl

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I thought that we were closer
Now it feels like I don t even know her
You would think that I never used to hold her
She believes everything that they told her
She was mad there was girls in the folder
Tried to tell her it was nothing but a photo
She gets advice from a friend that s lonely
I hope she hears these words that I say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don t listen to your friends
Follow your heart baby and let me in
Follow your heart baby and know that I m here
You know that I love you girl
So don t have no fear
She don t even talk to meIt's the most beautiful time of the year
Light fill the streets with so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the hoilday
But i stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But i'mma be under the mistletoe
With you
Shawty with you
With you
Shawty with you
Under the mistletoe
Was walking through the snow
When you hit my line
You said you wanna give this thing one more try
I prolly shoulda thought
Bout the thing you did
And how you broke my heart
Back when we were kids
I'd hate to hav  spend the winter all alon 
And even though
You're wrong for me
I feel at home don't know how this girl
Can have me feel so low
Yet somehow have me standing by the mistletoe
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Light fill the streets with so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the hoilday
But i stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But i'mma be under the mistletoe
With you
Shawty with you

Under the mistletoe[Chorus]
What do you mean  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean  Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean 
Oh, what do you mean 
Said you re running outta time, what do you mean 
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean 
Better make up your mind, what do you mean

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls 

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourselfWe were inseparable
Everything I had to do I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
OO you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have fractioned it

But there was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to

Being alone, alone, (All alone)
You adapted (You adapted), now your use to
Being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
OO you got used too being (Used to) on your own
(All on your own)[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday

Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight

On a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love 
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Life is worth living again[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's on  thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 2]
I've got to learn things, l arn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

'Said if you like th  way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee 
Can we both say the words and forget this
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now [Verse 1]

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee 
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 



[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this 

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

[Outro]
Is it too late now to say sorry 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now [Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It's what it's for yeah, it s what it's for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me 
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me 
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I'm thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Verse 1]
But, as I look around I see
Well nothing can never change me, yeah
Well all I gotta do is stay me
Let the rest do the work and I'll show that I'll be fine, be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It's what it s for yeah, it s what it's for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me 
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me 
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I m thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry

[Bridge]
Just put on my, just put on my, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat

I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
It was more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm the one you wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, yeah, you're my kind of perfect

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't work hard when it's easy

And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, yeah, you're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls 

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That s what we oughta do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don t wanna see us together now
Cause we are strong enough to endure, oh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 2]
Don t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don t wanna be left with the question, why 
Let s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain 

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now[Verse 1]
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept, ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

[Chorus]
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

[Verse 2]
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, ohh, for inn r peace
Ask you to forgive m  for my sins, oh would you please 
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my all into your hands
