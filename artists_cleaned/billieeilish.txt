[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you 
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already 
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul  So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me 
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again 
Would I do it again 
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead 
If I knew it all then, would I do it again 
Would I do it again 
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead [Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold 
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'  Is the amount cleanin' you out  Am I satisfactory 
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna  end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna 

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected 
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected 
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna  end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna 

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go [Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me I ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do 
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back 
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back 
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can t escape the way I love you
I don t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through 
Is there a 12 step just for you 
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way 
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you 
Was I reckless to help 
Was it obvious to everybody else 

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise 
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise 
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

[Outro]
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise 
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'I)

Da-da-da (Seye naeco esoht em evig uoy nehw)
Mmm (Yrc em ekam ot woh wonk yllaer uoy)
Mmm (Riaf on)

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 1]
Stop, what the hell are you talking about  Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

[Pre-Chorus]
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 2]
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you have fun 
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Bridge]
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am (I am)
I'm not your friend (Friend)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)
You think that you're the man (You're the man)
I think, therefore, I am (Therefore, I am)[Intro]
Mind
Mind

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind 
Where's my mind 

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind 
Where's my mind 
Where's my mind 
Where's my mind 

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind 
Where's my mind 

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one[Verse 1]
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you hear me 
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand 
I've changed my plans

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

[Verse 2]
I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren't I someone  (Aren't I someone  Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

[Chorus]
But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him 
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake[Verse 1]
What is it about them 
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating  Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when )

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them 
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry 
Won't you stay inside 
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go 
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, where did you go 
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go 
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, d j  vu (Hmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Outro]
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin  to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever  cause I don t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass  Can t you tell I'm wired 
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my  asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts  Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right 

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it  Did you like that 
Um, which part [Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin' 
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me 
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy 
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense 
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage
Like a hostage[Intro]
(Three and four and)
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
(What )

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you )
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Bridge]
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My boy, my (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright, dude, go trip over a knife)

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Outro]
You want me to be yours  Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours  Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom
Again 

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly 

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

[Bridge]
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen 
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything 

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be 
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me 
Me

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything [Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Well, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 1]
What is it you want 
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Bridge]
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"[Intro]
Hmm-mm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty 
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play[Intro]
Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what 
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Pre-Chorus]
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe 
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe 
I'm not your party favor[Verse 1]
Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

[Verse 2]
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh

[Bridge]
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of pain
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
You will never know[Intro]
Please, please
Don't leave  me
Be

[Verse]
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me 
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you 
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go  to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them 
I'm the bad guy[Intro]
Aah
Aah

[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Aah

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need  (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair
Aah

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored 
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone
(213) 267-9932, girl you know-ow-ow
I'ma make this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes, tell me you ain't a part of me, no fair

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & blackbear & Both]
No fair (Yeah, yeah-eah-eah)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared (Girl, I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes (Ocean eyes)
No fair (No fair, no fair)
You really know how to make me cry (Know how to make me cry)
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

[Verse]
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend 
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood

[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

[Bridge]
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

[Outro]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea[Verse 1]
Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be 
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy 

[Verse 2]
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be 
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide 
Or run for your life 
Or stand here and spend it with me 
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy 

[Bridge]
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

[Outro]
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agree
I was and you were happy[Spoken: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
My Invisalign has finally...
I have taken out my Invisalign
I have taken out my Invisalign, and this is the album
Hahahahahahahahahahaha, ahh[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes[Verse 1]
In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it on our own

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm still alive but my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay  You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Post-Chorus]
The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ladum, badum, mmmm[Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Chorus]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

[Outro]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it[Verse 1]
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay 
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

[Chorus]
To make me feel better, make it alright
To give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Verse 2]
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Bridge]
If you love me, let me go
If you love me, leave limbo

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Late night when you need my love)
(Call me on my cell phone)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen 
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything 

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be 
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me 

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through[Verse 1]
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Verse 2]
You're saying that you're sorry, so what 
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
It's time to come to terms
Put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
Telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Bridge]
So take this as my last goodbye
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach
Your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, ohDo you know me 
Really know me 
You have opinions
About my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares
Your disapproval
Or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them
I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller 
Weaker 
Softer 
Taller 
Would you like me to be quiet 
Do my shoulders provoke you 
Does my chest 
Am I my stomach 
My hips 
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted 
If I wear what is comfortable
I am not a woman
If I shed the layers
I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body
You still judge it
And judge me for it
Why 
We make assumptions about people
Based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more
If I wear less
Who will decide what that makes me 
What that means 
Is my value based only on your perception 
Or is your opinion of me 
Not my responsibility[Verse 1]
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep

[Verse 2]
Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Verse 3]
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now we've got it all

[Verse 4]
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Bridge]
I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Outro]
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad 

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm big, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad [Lyrics from Snippet]
I want you
I swear I'd stop breathing
If it would benefit you
If that s all I had to do, mm
I'll give up everything
Because I'm in love with you
Yes, I m in love with you

I'll give up everything
If it would benefit you
If that's all I had to do[Lyrics from Snippet]
I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in county
He's got a tattoo for his cousin

Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me
Another house on fire by Venice Beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't love me

I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, doesn't love me)
I don't need to know[Verse 1]
Hoy despert  con ganas de besarte
Tengo una sed de acariciarte
Enredarme a ti y no soltarte
Eres tan embriagante
Eres t 
Eres t 

[Verse 2]
Quiero contemplarte sin contar el tiempo
Dibujarte con mis puros recuer'os
En mi mente marcarme tus labios, tus besos
Estar aqu  otro momento
Eres t 
Eres t 
Eres t [Verse 1]
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Bridge]
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling
You something that you would not like me to tell you

[Verse 2]
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Outro: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party with you
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Billie Eilish]
You make me sad, boy
Well look who s sad, daddy

[MadeinTYO]
Givenchy on your kisses (I would)
Wanna lay down with your misses
(Oh yeah)
Wanna hear your heartbeat (listen up)
When we're apart we[Lyrics from Snippet]
I don't know
I just wish I wasn't breathing
If I wasn't breathing
Would that change your mind [Verse]
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning

[Chorus]
But where are you my angel now 
Don't you see me crying 
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the 
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind

And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We ve got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Chorus]
There s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 2]
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 3]
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you 
Or could I easily fill his shoes 
But you say no
You say no

[Chorus]
Now we re just outside of town
And you re making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She s got a boyfriend anyway

[Chorus]
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She s got a boyfriend anyway

[Outro]
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway[Verse]
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than l can 
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, l bet she's around

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

I don't like stayin' at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go 
I wonder how far down it is

[Chorus: Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
It used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore

[Verse 2, Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin fakin' it the best that I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go 
I wonder how far down it is

But nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
It used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore[Lyrics from Snippet]
Use me, 'cause everyone else is
What's the difference 

When you're lookin' at my lips
And not being legally allowed to kiss them[Lyrics from Snippet]
Baby, don't I look good 
Just waiting for you to call me
Baby, yeah I'm up to no good[Verse 1: Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they bawl when

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, Billie Eilsh, both]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still 
Do ya, do ya 

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still 
Do ya, do ya

Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel 
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh[Chorus]

Like a- wait
Like a river flows
Like a river flows
-(I'm just gonna not play it)
Surely to the sea
My darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can t help falling in love with youI don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to goYesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

        [Lyrics from Snippet]
Strange
Boy, you're acting shady[Intro]
Da, da da da, da da da da

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul  So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight (Mad tight, mad tight)
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me 
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy[Verse 1]
Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've a minute
We really need to talk
Wait - you know what
Maybe just forget it
Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Chorus]
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way...
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look - now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Chorus]
You hear "stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin' 
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me 
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy 
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Never let you burn
Let you burn, let you burn
Never gonna let you burn
Let you burnYou were from the North, I was from the South
We were from opposite places, different towns
But I knew it was good and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew

Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe 

I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins"

Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe 
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe 
And I should know
Yeah I should know

Yeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe 
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe 
And I should know
Yeah I should know
For I'm your secret aren't I babe 
Yeah I'm your secret aren't I babe 
Aren't I babe [Lyrics from Snippet]
Can you guess
What I'm thinking of [Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

[Drop]
Could roses...
Could roses...
Could roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly 

[Chorus 2]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain


[Drop]
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high

Those ocean eyes

[Outro]

        [Verse 1]
If I can't wake up
Would you still... something else
If I can't return your corpse
No, I'm still involved

[Verse 2]
If I can't [ ]
If I sit on the floor, on the floor
Can't you see 
He hurt her
How do you breathe
Without me 
How do you see me [Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'  Is the amount cleanin' you out  Am I satisfactory 
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
(Ahh)
(Ah-ahh)
End me
End me
End me
(Ahh)
End me
End me
End me

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'  Is the amount cleanin' you out  Am I satisfactory 
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly

What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 3: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected 
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected 
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm wreck-less

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better

They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Bringing us back to life
But you're cold as a night

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom

Again [Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
 Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city, you

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once (That's better)
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now
H-h-him right now

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
(Thanks)

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
Your love feels so fake
My demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now (Ahh)
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out
(B-b-blow them out)

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I'll sit and watch your car burn

Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
7-4-2008
I still remember that
Heaven sent a present my way
I won't forget your laugh
Packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back
Wanna see me down on my knees
But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro: Billie Eilish & Vince Staples]
Watch your car, watch your car burn
I won't forget your laugh
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
You know you coming back, you know you coming back
Watch your car, watch your car burn
(Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn)
Tryna even the score
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
Found guilty in the court of aorta[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

[Pre-Drop]
Could roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 
I remember you

[Drop]

(Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me)
(Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly )

I remember you[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Fuck all that, bitch
You can't have mine[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
If I 
If I 

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling's getting old
Was I made from a broken mold 
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
If I 
If I [Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus]
Another story
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Never let you
Watch your car, watch your car
Burn
Watch your car, watch your car
Never let you
Burn
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense 
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Verse 3]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

[Verse 4]
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
When you're with me and we're alone

        [Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need

My boy's being sus
He was shady as fuck
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like
I love my split ends and by that I mean
He cuts 'em off

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's being sus
And he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father
My boy's an ugly crier
But he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd "change"

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy

He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

You want me to be yours
Well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours
Well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you 
I've learned to lose, you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already 
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Do you wanna dance with your little girl 
In the shadows I can see those things you hid
From me
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, you wanna see me
You better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out
But down
Mmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, d j  vu

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, 'cause I'm leavin' soon

Sorry[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty 
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, hmm
Quiet, mmm
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, hmm

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense  (Hello )
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
When you're with me and we're aloneWe lay all day in our comfy bed, what a wonderful life
We play outside in the green grass, what a wonderful life
We smell all the roses in the rose bush, what a wonderful life
What a wonderful life, for us
What a wonderful life, for us[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)

You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Well, what a shame, I'm not there

What is it you want 
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair

I've been walking through a world gone blind

Those ocean eyesSo I just wanted to say something real quick, which is yesterday I was at Kimmel, which was amazing, and when I left I had to go to a rehearsal. So to walk to the car, there was an alley that I walked through. Like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans, and then like 500 feet to my right was what I thought was fans and paparazzi.

I started, I went to the left side. I walked all the way over to them and hugged them all, I took pictures and talked to them for a second. Didn't sign anything, because I like don't do that. That's something I don't do, because I used to and I realised all anyone did was sell everything that I signed so I stopped doing that. It's kind of a policy of mine that I don't.

So I talked to them, hugged them all, I went to the other side and as I got closer, like they were cheering for me and stuff, and shouting for my name and stuff, and so I walked.

And as I got closer, I kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers, which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all.

But I didn't want to like be disrespectful at all, so I went up to them all and I like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever, and I started to do that. Nobody put their hands out. Nobody tried to hug me back...I hugged one girl at the end, and so she was really sweet...

But then I tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were, not where the first group was, but like in the same area that I was in, because I thought that's where there were fans.

When I looked over there, they were gone. And I was like, OK well, I guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph, which I don't do because these bitches will sell that shit.

Like, I'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever, of course I'm gonna do that. But I have this whole thing about not signing things because I just want to be there. I'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit.

I don't do that, and I've tried to make that clear like a billion times,  and I said it before I went over to them.

Anyway.

I started to walk away, because I realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person. Um, and so I walked away.

As I started to walk away back to the car, they all started to boo me.

And then they all started calling me a little bitch, and saying I'm gonna lose my Grammy nominations, and you know, what a little fucking you know, whatever, just cursing me out and shit.

Damn, dude, like...

Then I started hearing them comparing, they kept being like, "Lorde would have stopped". I'm like, I did stop! I walked 500 fe- I walked like 1,000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch 

Like, the fact that people can switch up like that [clicks fingers]...damn. Like wait outside for you, and then immediately they don't get what they want, and they boo you and fucking curse at you.

I'm like, "Bro, I'm 17! You're ..." Oh my God, this shit is...[exasperated whoo!]! I turned around ready to fucking pounce, and then I got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction, which is probably good, and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but...

Mm...anyway, the only reason I'm making this video is because I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened. Because if you watch the video it literally looks like I'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not at all what happened.

I literally walked from the other side of the alley, which was like 1,000 feet. Which is fine, I'm like happy to do it. But I walked over there literally only to say hi, only to hug people. I literally went over and I was like, "I don't want pictures, I want to hug", and I got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face. And no love whatsoever.

So I left and then I got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that I'm gonna lose my Grammys.

I probably am gonna lose the Grammys, but it's okay though! I'm not worried about that, it's the nomination that counts!

Anyway! I don't know, I just wanted to, I don't even know...I went back to the other side where the real fans were and I was like, "Guys they booed me!" And they were very sweet. You guys are my friends, I love you a lot.

And to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch, I hope the best for you. I hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle. So yeah, all the best!

Love you paparazzi.[Verse 1]

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom
Again 
Again 
Again 

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
But I don't know, I don't know

And all I hav  to do is think of her
Something in the things sh  shows me

[Outro]
I don't want to leave her now
I don't want to leave her now[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Refrain]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
You should see me in a crown

[Drop]
You should see me in a crown
You should see me in a crown

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Refrain]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
You should see me in a crown

You should see me in a crown
You should see me in a crown[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I ll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin' 
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me 
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy 
Now you know
Now I m free

[Chorus]
I ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom
Again 

[Instrumental]I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again 
Would I do it again 
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead 
If I knew it all then, would I do it again 
Would I do it again 
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead [Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment 
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids[Intro]
Aah
Aah

[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Aah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need  (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored 
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need 
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
Those ocean eyes[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'  Is the amount cleanin' you out  Am I satisfactory 
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna  end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna 

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go 

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected 
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected 
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna  end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna 

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me 
What are you wondering  What do you know 
Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me 
When we all fall asleep, where do we go [Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow

Alright, alright, okay, here we go. We're really going for real, okay

[Chorus]
Mmm, all the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
I can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight, mm
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him 
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
Sing it, woo (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself, mm, has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team, mm

[Post-Chorus]
And my Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
And my god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save nowI've been watchin' you for some time

Burning cities and napalm skies

When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyesI heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night 
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that 
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then tell me, why you actin' cold to me 
You ain't the only one to blame, no
I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess that don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours any night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you 
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you 
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night 
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that 
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends 
Tellin' people that's how we been 
Tellin' everybody, yeah that we was barely speakin'
All this kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then 
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me
You missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh 
Why you playin' with my time, huh 
Told me we should let it go and put it all behind us
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk, then why you callin', huh 
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night 
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that 
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that 
Baby how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that 
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that 
No, no, how you gonna lie like that 
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night 
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that 
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that[Verse 1]

Alone with you - does that make sense 
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest

I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you

Like a hostage

[Verse 3]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

[Verse 4]
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean

Hey, leave a message

Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait - you know what 
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

Happy birthday by the way...

You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look - now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Chorus]
You hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops

Bite my tongue, bide my time
             
Wearing a warning sign
         
Wait 'til the world is mine
           
Visions I vandalize
           
Cold in my kingdom size
           
Fell for these ocean eyes
              

[Chorus 1]
You should see me in a crown
          
I'm gonna run this nothing town
          
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by
     
You should see me in a crown
          
Your silence is my favorite sound
           
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by one
     

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
                
Blood on a marble wall
       
I like the way they all
       
Scream
    
Tell me which one is worse
          
Living or dying first
     
Sleeping inside a hearse
      
I don't dream
      

[Pre-Chorus]
You say
  
Come over baby
      
I think you're pretty
      
I'm okay
   
I'm not your baby
        
If you think I'm pretty
        

[Chorus 2]
You should see me in a crown
          
I'm gonna run this nothing town
          
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by
     
You should see me in a crown
          
Your silence is my favorite sound
           
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by one
     

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
Crown
  
I'm gonna run this nothing town
          
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by
     
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
           (          )
Your silence is my favorite sound  (You should see me, see me)
            (          )
Watch me make 'em bow
          
One by one by one
     
One by one by one

Sen olmak istemiyorum
Art k sen olmak istemiyorum[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom
Again 

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly 

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom 
Could roses bloom 

[Bridge]
They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense 
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you

Like a hostage

[Verse 3]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

[Verse 4]
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you

Like a hostage[Intro]
Woo, I love the energy in here

[Verse 1]
Mmm, mm-mm, da-da-da
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean ey s
Those ocean ey s

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
I can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair, no fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes, those ocean eyes
(I'm scared) I'm scared
I've never, never, never, ooh (I've never fallen from quite this high)
Mmm (Fallin' into your ocean eyes)
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Ba-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ba-ba-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'I)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da, you must know this song

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul  So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that sad what  Hahahaha
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Uh, duh

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
I'm the sad type, what 
Uh, mm
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the m n I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't g t enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da, uh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-daWhite shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul  So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me 
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad[Intro]
Thank ya. Alright, um, the next one we're gonna play is-is very long and very sad. So, I don't know if you wanna, like, sit down on the floor, or some shit  I don't know if that's even possible, don't worry about it. Anyway, just relax, think about whatever you wanna think about. Um, just-just let this one be like one you don't worry about anything, yes  Okay. 

[Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do  Mm
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Mmm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back 
Say you were tryna make m  laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I lov  you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Mmm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back 
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
Do-do-do

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh[Intro]
That's right, alright. Oh, we back. Okay, you ready for this next one  I'm ready. Y'all it is fall, it is November, it is going to be December soon and it's time for this one to come back

[Verse 1]
Mm-mmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty 
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Quiet, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet
Hmm-mm

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promis  you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you k pt inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play[Intro]
Thank you. Okay, so I'ma do one more song and then I'm gonna go. But, um, I wanna thank you guys for coming and listening. Um, and, uh,  thank you so much to Jack White for having us and here being a boss, um, and-and inspiring a whole generation of people to do what they want. Um, and this place is so cool, it's like such an honor to get to be here and to do this. It's like the coolest thing ever. Do you see that  They're like making my voice onto a thing, like, that's crazy. Like, right now, it's crazy, heh. Um, so for this last one, um all I say all I wanna say and all I ask is that just we all to just try to be, um, just try to be, um, just happy that we're alive and happy that we're breathing and that we're here and we're safe and, um, that's pretty much it. Just be just for us to all be grateful that we're here right now on this Earth. Um, yeah, so thank you for having me. Let's do it. And thank you so much for giving me the energy you've been giving me

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you 
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already 
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer, call me back
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Outro]
Thank you guys, thank you, I love you. And thank you to my brother, Finneas who's my best friend in the whole world[Intro]
Ooh, mm

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You b tter love me, 'caus  you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny  Can't have mine[Intro]
Thank you, tee-hee-hee
Ah, this is a an oldie, mm

[Verse 1]
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Da-na-na-na-na
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold 
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistak 
Only you know the way that I break, uh

[Chorus]
If teardrops could b  bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest 
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
