You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect 
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

[Verse 2]

Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma (Dress is karma), perfume regret, yeah
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh

And now I'm all up on ya (All up on ya), what you expect  (Oh, baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh no

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new (One new)
Yeah, you just want attention (Oh), I knew from the start (The start)
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (Over you), oh

[Bridge]

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Outro: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez, Both]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh

(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, whoa
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore[Intro]
Alright
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl 
Can't you blame my head and not my heart 
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies 
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on

Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

[Verse 2: Kehlani]

Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide (Oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay
I promise myself one day
(Hey!)

[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (Oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before (It was nothing like before)
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (Surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay
(Baby, now, that's okay)
I promise myself one day

But that's just the way I am[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry
It doesn't have to end this way

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now (yeah)

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
When did we lose our way 
My whole world was unravellin'
And girl, it's drivin' me insane
There's no road worth travellin'

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men]
When I think about all of the nights you're gone (Nights you're gone, oh)
I get terrified (I get terrified)
Please don't say goodbye (bye)

[Chorus: Wanya Morris with Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out (oh)

And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I can promise if we parted, parted
And if you left me brokenhearted
Every single night, I'll think about you with someone else
Baby, if you leave me

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Baby, if you leave me now (leave me now)
Oh, if you're givin' up and just walk right out (hey)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out (oh, baby)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now[Verse 1]
This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, it my head up
There's no forgetting you

[Pre-Chorus]
You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

[Chorus]
I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously

[Verse 2]
Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train and I
M tied to the track

[Pre-Chorus]
You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

[Bridge]
You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

[Breakdown]
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously

It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I guess I thought you was, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away 
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way  Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Verse 2]
Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away  (Run away)
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (Everything)
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late (Gettin' late)
But can I still be on my way, on my way  Yeah

Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Bridge]
Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away, yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

These mistakes, I ve made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn t there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby, I m still your man, I swear

[Chorus]
Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I m not what you need
But baby, I m gonna be

[Verse 2]
Is it too much (Is it too much ) that I m asking for 
Can we start over  (Can we start over ) Can we end this war 
I ve been taking your love, I ve been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind 
Before you (yeah) go walking out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you know I m not perfect
If you leave, I deserve it
But baby, all I m asking you is please, please (Oh)

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1]
Why'd you have to leave so soon, yeah 
Why'd you have to go 
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most 
'Cause I don't know really how to tell you without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place, but it's always gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you told me I don't have to worry

You said you had nothing to hide, that you left him long ago
I shoulda known that was a lie

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when you said, "Do not tell anybody
'Cause if ya do, I'll be the first to put my hands around your throat" 
If you had nothing to hide, why is no one s'posed to know 
I shoulda known that was a lie

[Chorus]
I (I) warned myself (Warned myself) that I shouldn't play with fire (Oh no)

[Outro]
The reason why[Verse 1]
I got these girls tryna lock me down
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I don't know where to go
After you loved me this way
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay 

[Chorus]
You tell me I'm too young, but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the '90s
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy (Go and treat me like)

[Verse 2]
You told me you needed a perfect guy
That'll make your parents proud
Guess you still ain't found him yet (Why )
'Cause we're still messin' around (Oh)
And now you watch me put in all this work
Just to say it won't work out (Work out)
You never took me seriously (Took me seriously)
Now, what the hell is that about

One, two, three, four
Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers 
Isn't love, all that we got 
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother 
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

[Verse 1: James Taylor, Both]
Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around
What a waste, another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can t we just get along 
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other 
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can t we just get along 

[Verse 2: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]
What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing 
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can t we just get along 
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other 
We gotta make that change, yeah

I know we could break apart
We don t have to go that way
Not today

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do

Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo (Back of the Benzo)

Told you I'm moving on to bigger and better things
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on, and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather

My life is complicated, she's only 23
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over
The harder she makes it to go

And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, "Who is that, babe "
And the way you said, "Nobody"
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, do you think they'll notice if we slip away 
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say
Oh, right now we're in the rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

[Chorus]
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (me and you) and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room ('nother room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (me and you) and these empty cups
All of these empty cups
Baby, all of these empty cups

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

[Chorus]
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (me and you) and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room ('nother room)
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you (me and you) and these empty cups
(On your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you)
All of these empty cups
(If you wanna like I wanna, let me take you to another room, oh baby)
Like it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups[Verse 1]
You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young
The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay
I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break (Yeah)
I've already fell so many times, but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

[Verse 2]
Growing up in this wild city, you had to fight or run
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I've been through it all
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all[Verse 1]
I should have told you how I really feel
A little in advance
Then I would ve had some time to go and work it out
I think I ve lost my chance

[Pre-Chorus]
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you d figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you d ever say "goodbye"
If I didn t say it first

[Chorus]
I m done playing these games
I can t believe what I m about to say
I won t tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

[Verse 2]
No, no more nights
Drink until my loneliness
Up till two A.M

No, no more waiting
Pacing 'round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in

[Pre-Chorus]
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you d figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you d ever say "goodbye"
If I didn t say it first

[Chorus]
I m done playing these games
I can t believe what I m about to say
No, I won t tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

[Bridge]
Ooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Outro]
I m done playing these games
I can t believe what I m about to say
'Cause I would rather die than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No, I would rather die than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind[Verse 1]
When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone (Whoa, oh)
Every single moment will be faded into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you (Whoa, oh)
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Verse 2]
When we're old and gray (Yeah)
And our faces changed (Whoa, oh)
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love (Listen)
And every story ends
But we could still pretend (Yeah, yeah)
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Bridge]
I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love[Verse 1]
Tell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

[Pre-Chorus]
And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better 
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different 

[Verse 2]
And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better 
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different 
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better 
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different 

[Bridge]
Girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better 
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different 
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better 
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different [Chorus: Charlie Puth]

I d stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
And walk out with a million bucks
Then I'd burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
Just to prove it didn't mean that much
I'd sell everything I own, take a pile of cash
Walk into the casino, bet it all on black
Then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
To make out with you in the back, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I m not afraid to look insane
'Cause I m crazy about ya

[Chorus]
There's nothing that I won t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me, baby

Just need you and I could care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl, there's nothing I won t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I'd buy a couple red-eye one-way tickets
To Paris to our first class ride
Then I'd carry your body to the top of the tower
To kiss your lips at midnight
Then we ll wander through the streets and drink champagne
Get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
I'll acapella karaoke  Sexy Thing 
'Cause baby, I feel no shame
Say this whole world can know you're all I need
'Cause baby, some day, I'll drop and hit one knee and tell ya

'Cause I m crazy about ya

[Bridge]
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Throw myself out of a jet air plane
Hundred feet a second, just screaming your name
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Pick you up and drive it around 'til dawn

This time next year
I'm gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view

[Chorus]
I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way

And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

'Cause this time next year
I'ma walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see
Gonna see me
And I'ma call every girl that turned me down
And tell 'em now that
I'm just too busy
'Cause I don't have the time
And it's funny how my so-called friends
Who've always left me alone
Are suddenly running into me
And blowin' up my phone

[Chorus]
I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'

[Verse 1]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just keep it to myself

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low

Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Oooh, ooooh, ooooh[Intro]
I'm run, yeah, oh yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind

[Verse 1]
It's funny how I got just exactly what I want
I'll try to have fun some other time
I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush
I'll try to go find some other high

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

[Chorus]
So much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind

[Verse 2]

Thinkin' back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days, baby, you were the truth
And nothing you could do will ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts, girl, forget what they do
But somewhere down the line, I left you hanging

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I ll never break your heart again

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are (are), are (are), are
I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are (are), are (are), are

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing, more nothing less, you're the real
I wanna take this time to thank you, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I ll never break your heart again

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]

Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are (are), are (are), are
I, I will always love you (I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you (I could never judge you)
I'll take you as you are (are), are (are), are

[Verse 3: Shy Carter & Charlie Puth]
So let it be known now
The queen on my throne now
It's you at all times
I'll never reject you
I'll love and respect you
'Cause you're my lifeline
Only thing on my wish list
Your love and forgiveness
For that, I will climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Why would I fight it 
I know that it's right when you're holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I'll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I'm yours
You know that I'm yours

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause I, I will always love you (I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you (I could never judge you)
I would take you as you are (are), are (are), are
I, I will always love you (Darling, I will always love you)
(I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are (are), are (are), are[Verse 1]
Well, I get a thrill from down my spine
When I see you hittin' me up
Feelin' so electrified
Like the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Verse 2]
So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
'Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Bridge]
If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Outro]
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry[Intro]
Ohh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed
Some girls be cravin' that attention to be seen
But the one I'm lookin' at is right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

[Verse 2]
Some girls, they hit me up sayin', "What you doin' now "
But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wonderin' why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me now

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo

[Bridge]
Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed

[Chorus]
There's beautiful, and then there's you, oh
There's beautiful, and then there's you
(Did you know you're beautiful, baby )
There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you

[Outro]
There's beautiful, and then there's you[Verse 1]
Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just don't feel right
Every time one of us tries to leave here
Oh, the other one holds on tight, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

[Verse 2]
You tell me someone's waiting for ya
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and draw the blinds and lock all the doors

[Chorus]
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us, you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

[Bridge]
Oh, if you want me like I want you
I won't judge you, this could be our little secret (Secret)
Our secret (Secret)
So tell me if you're ready
'Cause if no one knows then it ain't really cheating (Cheating)

[Verse 3]
Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just feels so right
Cause every time one of us
Tries to justify the situation, we just hold on tighter, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us, you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been hurtin' lately
I m down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this, baby
But I know I can't give up
Tough times, I just take them in stride

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, I'm movin' on, I got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

[Verse 2]
I said times are changin'
Tell me, how can I keep up 
Every time I turn around, there's a wall
But I m climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you re brokenhearted and you're love's departed
Yeah, you gotta walk alone, yeah, it's true
Flash every smile 'cause I've been lost for miles
'Cause yeah, I know you've felt this way before too

[Chorus]
Mmm, we're almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, we re movin' on, we got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we're almost, there only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

[Bridge]
Mmm, I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

[Chorus]
We're almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
We're movin' forward and there s no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we re almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we re almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left[Intro]

They ll never know just who you are
But they can t turn your bright star dark
They'll try to hold your spirit down
Couldn't do it then, can't do it now
They'll try to tell you who to be
But they can't change the way you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free

[Chorus]
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free (Free), free (Free)

[Verse 2]
They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you w re built too strong for that

Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back, running fast and free

[Chorus]
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Smile when you're talking to me
I don't wanna know your real pain
Long nights, I don't know your real name
Soft kiss when the yellow cab came
Til the next time when the sun fall
And my thoughts roam and the love calls
For your soft tone and your sweet talk
And your dial tone when you're not bothered
Hoping feelings never get brought up
Conversation never get broad
Still blind by the street lights
Never gonna let another man cross
Yes, I understand
Baby, loosen up your pants
Staring at me from your knees
Birds and the fucking bees

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me sufferLyrics from Snippet

Yeah, me and you[Verse 1]
If, I'm gonna fall
Will you promise me I'll always have a kingdom 
'Cause I, I have it all
But you're taking everything I ever dreamed of

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah

A feeling I know too well

[Chorus]
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

[Verse 2]
If, I had a choice
I suppose I'd have to do it all over
'Cause when, I hear your voice
Part of me just wants to be a little closer

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Okay
This is a song about how I used to get really scared around girls
And it goes like this

[Chorus: Jackson 5 Sample (Charlie Puth)]
Won't you please let me
Back to your heart 
(Yeah, alright)
Won't you please let me (I'm gonna go in now, this is me going in)
(Here we go)
Back to your heart (Okay)

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
'04, seventh grade
High top Adidas and I thought I had game
But it turns out that I didn't and I learned the hard way
When I walked up to this girly and I asked her "What's your name "
She said "Don't, stop! Why are you talking to me 
You're the new kid in town and you look like you're three
And it's easy to see by your pale-ass skin
That you're always home alone, McCauley Caulkin"
I need consultin' for all of my fears
'Cause I didn't have another girl for four more years
And they gave me every one of their gracing chances
Paid no attention to all their advances
But freshman in college I found my first love
And I took her out to dinner and I thanked the gods above
But when she went to give me a kiss had a pain in my stomach
Too much food, had to vomit
(Ugh, we should do this again sometime -- BLUGH)

[Chorus: Jackson 5 Sample (Charlie Puth)]
(Ugh, I swear this never happens)
Won't you please let me
Back to your heart
(Oh baby please give me another chance! We could go to the good-house garden)
Won't you please let me (Yeah)
Back to your heart

[Verse 2: Mike Ballz]
Mike Ballz did it, oh!
Oh damn
These girls all assessing me
In a line-up, but they ain't selecting me
I'm too obedient and missing one ingredient
I need a little L-O-V-E up in this recipe (Yup)
But they say "nice guys finish last"
So I gotta be an ass if I win my class
Nah, nope, I just can't do it
Maybe they'll be feeling me now I that make some music
Maybe not, I'll go right till I'm famous
Flaunt all of my swag, I'll snag me at A-list
Hey, Taylor Swift, are you feeling this 
Give a rapper a chance
Somebody make sure that she's hearing this
But I'm for real, shit, I just need a chance
Seventh grade girls were laughing at me when I ripped my pants
I'm no Brad Pitt or George Clooney
But I'm a real dude that can make your life feel like a movie

In front of your mirror, you turn the curtain down
I couldn't be any clearer what we're gonna do now

I wanna put you down when we're faded
And at the top of your lungs, you'll be screaming my name
And we've gone too far to go the other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll pick you up and lay you on the kitchen counter
Said you couldn't do without it, I'm okay if you're about it
Down in every direction, got me hypnotized
I'm hallucinating, going out of my mind

Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real

'Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true

And to climb down the shakers of your house
To the back of my Chevy and no one will ever know

Oh Melanie I don't believe

Because ninety-nine percent of the time I'm hurting
The other one makes it go away

This toxic love, we've been going through
Like deja vu
But (...)

I feel like my heart is bleeding
Can't make up my mind

I know
The deep (...)[Verse 1]
Midnight, lock all the doors
Keep playing that song all day
Just the sound of the traffic
The patron of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering why I came
I said I'll try not to think of you
If you say you don't feel the same

[Chorus]
Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

[Verse 2]
Feels like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Oooh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah, I should have shut my stupid mouth

The long table
The boomerang
Traveling way down south
And it's ironic 'cause it's probably the last time that you see me around

[Chorus]
Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oh yeah
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

[Outro]
I said I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

1, 2, 3....

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Verse 2]
C'mon baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
C'mon baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place, place, place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep "doin' it" and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else, yeah
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Bridge]
Get someone you love 
Get someone you need 
F... that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love 
Get someone you need 
F... that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Outro]
Oh
Somebody else
Somebody else
Ooh[Verse 1]
Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay
I promise myself one day

[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this
Life ain't nothing like it was before
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface
Baby, I'm a little insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay
I promise myself one day

[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

[Refrain]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Bridge]
Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along
Ohh

[Breakdown]
Everybody's tryna be famous
What was it  haha

[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

[Refrain]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Da, da, da, da, da[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's kama sutra show and tell

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Woah-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song

I'm screamin' mercy, mercy, please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 2: Wale]
Chocolate city, we back baby
I go verse to verse with the top MC's
When it come to girls, they ain't on my league
I'm like Mr. Marvin pulling up to that party singing
Mercy, Murcielago me
Man, baby you phat, mean that outta respect
Hello, wake up, girl
Kill a nigga with sex
We might turn it to real
All I need to get fly
The way I propel, bottle rocket or jet
A6, Greystone with 8 chicks
Guarantee if they act bad, then they rich
I'm like Marvin in his prime
Even though he not around, know the city still got him

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Woah-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

Until the dawn

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, babe
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screamin' mercy, mercy, please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on[intro]

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl 
Can't you blame my head and not my heart

Hello, ladies
I may have had to use a pitch bender to make my voice sound lower than it really is
But I just wanted to tell you that.. that

[Chorus]
I am so hot, hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside, outside I'm bound to start a forest fire

[Verse 1]
I'm so hot that in cold weather
You're gonna wanna take off your sweater
No need for hats and gloves
Charlie Puth is gonna warm you up with his love
(Or maybe not)
What the hell's a fireplace 
(Who knows )
If you're chilly you will really want me in your face
(Hello there!)
Fishes were cold-blooded at one time
But that all changed when I went for a dive

[Pre-Chorus]
Halle Berry and the sun have got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty
Did I mention that I

[Chorus]
I am so hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside I'm bound to start a forest fire

[Verse 2]
"DJ, turn me up"
Is something someone said who is not really hot
In comparison to me, who is dripping with hot
Man, I can't help you with something that you're not
(Good God, you're ugly!)
Sunburned people and polar ice caps
They all hatin' on me
(They wack!)
But alligators, Jersey Shore Guidos, and photosynthesis
They all got my back, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Emma Watson and the microwave ain't got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty, oh!
Um, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I am so hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside I'm bound to start a forest fire
I am so hot, hot, hot[Verse 1]
You sing yourself to sleep at night
Melodies behind closed doors
I'm over by the corner
Listening to you from the second floor

[Verse 2]
I open up the curtains
To hear the thunder and the rain
We dropped off all the flowers
To wash away the pain

[Bridge]
Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere
Wanna go with you anywhere

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you

[Verse 4]
But these tangerine dreams will not go away
I build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just give me company
Now I take everyday with a deep breath
'Cause I found out the hard way when he left
Suffering silently

[Chorus]
These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again

[Chorus]
These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again[Intro/Chorus]
(Oh) I m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I m going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) I said, they're nothing but trouble

[Verse 1]
She s leading me on the round
That s perfect but closing down
I m crying day you gone
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more
She s so good at playing cards
But the minute she brings you joy
She s showing you the door
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more

[Chorus]
(Oh) I m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I m going for throttle
(Oh) Oh, these instagram models
(Oh) I said, they're nothing but trouble

[Verse 2]
She s situated on her roof
Now so tired of waiting her turn
And I ain't tryna go home
Can't take this no more
Ain't taking it no more
And I never believed it would actually happen
Your body's so tempting, my sweetest distraction
Lets get down on the floor
Can t take this no more
Can t take this no more

[Bridge]
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Chorus]
(Oh) I m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey[Intro]
One, two
One, two three, woah!

[Verse 1]
How many ways, I'd better say that you could be the one
I wrote you every song and here some more
Now I'm left with none
"I think you're beautiful"
Just doesn't work for you
You're back to square one
Thinking of somebody new

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every line will come out wrong
I can't describe you in a song
You see the signs, that's me and you
We both colliding, and that's the truth

[Chorus]
You don't even know and
You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
How many times you gonna throw my shit up out your room
We'll stay inside get high and lounge the rest of the afternoon
You're so imperfect, and it's so worth it
We'll conversate for a few
'Cause in a few we gon' do what we came to do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every line will come out wrong
I can't describe you in a song
You see the signs, that's me and you
We both colliding, and that's the truth

[Chorus]
You don't even know when
You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
So tell me you need me, hey
Tell me you need me
One, two three, whoah!

[Chorus]
You still don't even know when
You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to say 
I wanna look you in the eyes and tell you it's okay
But I can't, it hurts to know
At the end of the day, all I can do is hope
Hope to my core
'Cause I don't know anymore
Thought that heroes don't fall out the sky

[Chorus]
That was before you got sick
Before they found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now

[Verse 2]
Every night, every day
You were fighting but you never showed it on your face
I don't know what I would do
Baby, I would be so lost if I ever lost you
Oh, in my dreams
There I used to see
From a distance, I'd watch you fly

[Chorus]
That was before you got sick
Before they found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now

[Bridge]
I wanna hold all of your tears
And use them all to wash away the hurt
I wanna save you from your fears
Just to get you back the way you were

[Outro]
Before you got sick
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right now
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right now[Verse 1]
I've been trying and there's no denying
That girl you've got my heart falling so fast
My mind's racing, you've got me wasting
My days were endless till I see you pass

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm like
(Ooo-ooo)
Baby did I catch your eye 
(Ooo-ooo)
Can I see you tonight 

[Chorus]
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
(Come home with me)

[Verse 2]
Take my hand girl, we'll cross this land till
We find a place that we can all our home
Trust in me and I'll set you free
Babe I'm never ever leave you feeling cold

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me like
(Ooo-ooo)
Tell me I'm the only one
(Ooo-ooo)
And I'll see you tonight

[Chorus]
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me

[Bridge]
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
With me, with me (me x6)

[Chorus]
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with, home with me

[Outro]
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
My baby left me yesterday
Packed her bags and went away, yeah
High heels on the carpet
Took my keys and craved her name into my car seat
And that's the last one I let push me around
I said it before but I mean it now, eh
Get me out this city
I just need to clear my mind

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
We left this evening
Give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, off
When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all
We'll have it all

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
One shot, one shot for my sorrows, oh yeah
Power up the white noise, maybe I'll forget her deep into the morning
And right inside this yellow house
I'm reading CDs on the couch
But it's better than being stranded
Nothing but myself, my studio apartment

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
We left this evening
Give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, off
When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all
We'll have it all

[Verse 3: Mike Ballz]
I don't think I'm sleeping tonight
Something 'bout my stomach doesn't feel right
What you left in my chest on the left side
Where your head-- nah, fuck it
Time to take a drive
Night skies got me feeling like Bruce Wayne
'Cept all I got is a pocket of loose change
Head and heart got me thinking that I'm too strange
Well maybe I'm different
Word to two chains, two lanes
Drift grip the wood crane
Lookin' at the exit signs, but it's your name (damn)
On some purple rain shit, feelin' like Prince
Gotta go and change my name chiz, same shit, ain't it 
Yeah, I know I don't seem complacent
Got enough on my chest but my heart's still vacant
And I can't take it
My love is unreciprocated
I've been through enough without ever gettin' the payment
But it's harder to heal than it is to endure
There's only so much that the liquor can cure
And all that liquor that's poured gave you a head of a tornado
Of every memory that had you trippin' before
All that Christian Dior denim, Louis Vuitton leather
Led 'em a late night, safe flight and good weather
Ain't enough to make me feel better
Ain't enough to make me forget all those nights in early December

[Spoken: Mike Ballz]
I think I was dreamin'
But now I know I ain't been sleepin'
And some of these days, these feelings stoppin' me from eating
The pit of my stomach is heavy
I guess that's how it feels when you start to forget me
I apologize for not caring for myself
I've never known anything else than putting myself after everyone else
And that fucks me up, it's true
These late nights really are new
And there's so little I can do besides drive
Lay awake think about where you lay in the night
And fantasize about us living life in paradise
In a warm place where we never really have to die
But life ain't kind, we can't live fantasy
I just need to hear that you're maintaining sanity
Cuz it's more important to me that you're doing alright
Than the fact that I'm not sleepin' tonight[Intro]
Woah-oah, hm-hmm

[Verse 1]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect 
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

[Refrain]
You just want attention
You just want attention
You just want attention
You just want attention
Ohh

[Verse 2]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

Every party in LA

Somebody give me, uh
Somebody give me the answer
You and me isn't the answer
You and me isn't
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be, if I knew how you felt about me 

[Post-Chorus]
It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
Part of me that cared inside it's gone
And I know, that I can't, get caught up

[Chorus]
We could've been
And we tried to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've, damn[Verse 1]
Where you think to go now, sexy lady 
You make it so damn hard to leave
Love the way you've been doing it lately, ooh
Love the way you back it up on me
Ey

Your body's craving the attention, no disrespect to you
I really wanna ditch, let's get together
So we can take a little rendezvous

[Chorus]
Eh
She said
You know where to find me hey
You know where to find me work work
You know where to find me
Wanna see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's

[Verse 2]
Tryna do a little less conversation
Tryna cut right to the chase
Oh
This big beat bumping 808 drum
Tonight we're goin all the way

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

[Emily]
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul 

[Charlie & Emily]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Emily]
Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up

[Charlie & Emily]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend
At least we didn't intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

[Emily]I won't give up...

[Charlie &Emily]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up[Instrumental]

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl 
Can't you blame my head and not my heart 
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on 
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"

When I say it only happened once, mmm

You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1]
Why'd you have to leave so soon
Why'd you have to go
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most
"Cause I don't really know how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]

To carry on

When I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again[Verse 1]
There's a moment when you find out who your true friends are
The ones who don't go by everyone else's ways
And it's important to realize who your one and true love is
And to not look back on yesterdays

[Chorus]
Don't be askin' what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
'Cause you do you better than anyone here
So mark this as your year

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'm going on that train and I'm gonna pretend that it doesn't stop
'Cause I'm taking all my fears and making them my destination
Bottom all the way to the top

[Chorus]
Don't be askin' what this world needs now
I need to see what makes me come alive somehow
'Cause I do me better than anyone here
So mark this as my year

[Chorus]
Don't be askin' what this world needs now
I need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
'Cause I do me better than anyone here

I have no fear, 'cause all my obstacles are clear[Intro]

Yo
(Hi okay)

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Ellen DeGeneres
You so generous
Thanks for throwing me on TV
As a result my story's neater
And my swag is off the meter
Los Angeles NYC
I I-I-I I'm doing me
Why you gotta copy me
And pretending that you're always something new
Bitch you Microsoft
Stealing from Macintosh
I ain't Adele
I ain't Someone Like You
S-someone like you
Always smells
And you smell like a glove
I'm the cleanest motherfucker on the block
Dove
The girls always tend to show me what 
Love
Here's a bit of a prepositional phrase:
Of
This is me
On the beat
And I'm moving your feet
Head-shoulders and your shoulders and your toes
There's a lot of love in life
And you gotta get it right
So here's something that you probably know:

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I like girls, girls
Gi-gi-gi-girls
Girls I can't ignore
When they're sexy, naughty
A little bit raunchy
I always come back for more
I like girls, girls
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girls
Girls have got a hold on me
So if you wanna look me up
The name is C-H-A-R-L-I-E

[Verse 2: Vail]
Try'na make a name
Get into the game
Hope you feel the same
Hey, call my name
Make you go insane
Come, choose my aim
I was making brain
Kids will call me lame
Cause I'm failing tests
(Why you so dumb )
You don't know what prep school is like
Just like I never won a fight
Just because you know me
Doesn't mean that you're my homie
Thinking you can get above me
But I fucked you right and sorry
Just in case you have yet to hear
I am the rapper that you fear
I don't know cause I'm not broke
Put some clothes and money first
Let you listen while you work
Drop a dollar go berserk

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth and Vail]
Yeah
Drop it drop it drop it low
Drop it drop it drop it low
Drop it drop it drop it low

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I like girls, girls
Gi-gi-gi-girls
Girls I can't ignore
When they're sexy, naughty
A little bit raunchy
I always come back for more
I like girls, girls
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girls
Girls have got a hold on me
So if you wanna look me up
The name is C-H-A-R-L-I-E[Verse 1]
It's 10 p.m. and I am missin'
My seventh song for December 2nd
My mind's gone blank
I cannot think clear
About the lyrics
For this damn song here

[Pre-Chorus]
How do people have the attention span
To go and do this 
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

[Verse 2]
It's 12 A.M. and I am so screwed
Looking up at people falling on YouTube
Getting so bored to the highest degree
This must be so easy for Kenny G

[Pre-Chorus]
How do people have the attention span
To go and do this 
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits
Another sappy love song
My listeners will be pissed
I would seriously pay someone
Right now to go and help me with this

[Chorus]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics

[Bridge]
I suck
At writing lyrics

[Verse 4]
How do people have enough
Motivation to go and do this 
Feels like a day in this chair
And I haven't written down shit
Feel like I'm running out of ideas
For all these pieces
And every time I try to get done
Procrastination increases

[Chorus]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain


[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Verse 1: CASH L3WIS]
I get home from work, you get home from work
You on the phone though, can't put it down like it's a curse
It's the worst, all I want is time with you
But it's hard to find, a few minutes that align with you
I get inclined to decline that you're mine the truth
Is in the lines, I design in my mind - the booth
Is where I find - I can rhyme & release the flow
Of the pain obtained while being alone, don't wanna know


[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain


[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez / CASH L3WIS]
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Verse 2: CASH L3WIS]
I Don't know where you've been
But I know You've been lost
Covered in frost bite, I'm up all night
With a beer and a cross, sitting across
From an empty vessel
Sad shell of what used to be
& I'm confused as to who you really are anymore
How'd we lose what was you and me
All your fluidity turned to acidity
Visibly hindering ability
Like you wanna get rid of me
And I'm not really sure that you're into me, anymore
Which is injuring me even more
Why'd you lock your love up in a drawer
Cutting and stabbing my heart to the core
You just ignore, so


[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez / CASH L3WIS]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore (nah)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do (nah)
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for  (tell me)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I miss you


[Outro: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain[Demo Project]

[Chorus]
Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes[Verse 1]
They say the first line of the song is the hardest to come up with
But I just can t help writing about you
And I know this may sound cheesy in a lot of different ways
I swear all of the things I say are true

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

[Chorus]
You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

[Post-Chorus]
So give her your attention and it ll turn into something
Good

[Verse 2]
Well, I was walking down MacArthur Park
Just to find someone
Who steal my heart
But it seems like the classmate [ ] love your face
And if the way that you talk
And the way that you walk
Had a [ ] between in something of mine
I d sure give up the weller in a day

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

[Chorus]
You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

[Post-Chorus]
So give her your attention and it ll turn into something
Good

[Bridge]
She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
She makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

[Chorus]
You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

[Outro]
To others, to others, to others
I ll let your heart decide for you
And walkin  and talkin  with her like you should
So be good to her
And it ll turn up to something very good

        [Verse 1]
Monday you hate to drive home
With a million red lights on the strip
That night, I come to your door
You re the one I ve so desperately missed

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember always staying home with me
And watching friends
Well I d do anything for that again

[Chorus]
Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
Don t leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you ll feel the same way
Tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone

Ooh~

[Verse 2]
In my fantasy, I see you next to me
Every night, every day
This empty room feels so strange
Wanna stay, here with you
Go all the way, this afternoon
You caught me with nothing to say
(Caught me with nothing to say~)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember when I d always
Lie with you til  3 a.m
Well I d give anything for that again

[Chorus]
Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
(With me up in Boston)

And I wonder if you ll feel the same way tomorrow
(Same way tomorrow)
If you see me calling your phone
(You see me calling your phone)

[Bridge]

And I wonder if you ll feel
The same way tomorrow
(Same way tomorrow)
When you see me calling your phone
(You see me calling your phone)

[Outro]
When you ll see me calling your phone
Your phone
When you see me calling your phone[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy 
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste 

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead[Verse 1]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
(Ohh)
And I reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
(Ohh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus]
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
(I need you now)
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
(I need you now)
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
(Looking at you)

[Verse 2]
Another shot of whisky
Can't stop looking at the door
And I was wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
(Ohh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
(Looking at you)
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus]
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
(I need you now)
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
(I need you now)
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

(Oh Ohh...)  (Yeahh...)

Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

[Outro-Chorus]
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
(need you now)
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh, baby I need you now

(Looking at you) (Looking at you)   (I can reach your mind...)(TikTok Snippet)
Girl, I really trusted you
Tore my heart right into two

Till I caught you with another dude

Fool me once, you fool me twice
All you did was tell me lies
Should ve taken their advice
Now my heart is cold as ice[Intro]

This goes out to the most beautiful girl that I saw just the other day
She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away
This goes out to the one and only Miss Mysterious
The thought of being next to her has got me so delirious
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there 
Is she out there 
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there 

[Chorus]
'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way
Girl you got me love sick and
Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever feel the same 
Never been acquainted
I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

[Verse 2]
Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
'Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
'Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true 
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there 
Is she out there 
(Oooh)
Just tell me if you're out there, if you're out there

[Chorus]
'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for

Like we used to do
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore[Verse 1]

But for every time I saw you block my call
I wish I never been with you at all

I wish you and I could go and press rewind

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for

Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Intro]
After all this time
I, I realized you were holding me back

How can I be something predictable
I can't believe I thought you were wonderful

She couldn't wait anymore

[Phone rings, playing "I'm So Hot"]

"Hey Charlie, wanna hang out "

Yeah sure, I'll pick you up right now

Charlie the dumbass slept through his alarm
Then stalked his friends on Facebook
And then went to an office party
He doesn't even work in an officeLyrics from Snippet

You're not my best friend
That's what you showed me
So you can stop pretending like we are homies
You're not a real friend
You're fake as they come
Like everybody told me you were from day one
You're not my, uh

Were you fuckin  her the whole time [From Snippet]

Miss the way I used to make you say
I'll make you say, yeah
You're gonna miss the way I
You could have stayed and worked it outLyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Oh, I think it's best we stay, stay away from each other
'Cause we can be just occasional lovers
Even though I love the pain
Even though I wanna stay
It's best we stay, stay away from each other

[Verse 1]
Hey, here's something that I never thought that I would say
To a person who is beautiful in every way
But your love ain't doing it for me no more, baby, no more, baby
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I, had plans for our whole life
Now it's looking like I don't know where I'll be
What I wanted was hopeful for you and I
But I guess it's just not our reality, so I think it's

[Chorus]
B st we stay, stay away from each other
'Caus  we can be just occasional lovers
Even though I love the pain
Even though I wanna stay
It's best we stay, stay away from each other

[Verse 2]
Hey
So I'm...[Verse 1]
I heard you slam the door
And fall right to the floor
You kept on crying
That look upon your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like this
Makes me wanna die

[Verse 2]
We lie beneath the stars
Just two foolish hearts
Familiar faces
Now I lie here all alone
Sitting by the phone
There's too much space here

Oh baby, come back and stay with me

[Chorus]
Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me

It's never over to me

[Verse 3]
My heart
(My heart)
Is your's
(Is your's)
For yesterdays and for taking it
My heart
(My heart)
Is broken
You're all that I need

[Outro]
Just don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)
Don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)
Don't forget about me
Oh me, Oh me
Cause letting you go hurt me

[Chorus]
Cause this is not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause this is not over
To me, to me, to me

Never over you and me[Verse 1: Robert Gillies]
Bluebird, sweet bluebird
How you remind me of a girl
Who took from me my world
She stole every heartbeat
But I'd like to say I gave them first
To save me from this curse

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Bluebird, sweet bluebird
Outside my window with nothing to say
But sing of better days
But those days ain't coming
Feel like just running away
Running away

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking us apart
It's best stay we apart, best we stay apart

[Verse 3: Robert Gillies]
Bluebird, sweet bluebird
It seems like years since you've been here
Since the day you disappeared
Though my heart's still aching
I know you're safe where you are
Wherever you are

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is

[Bridge: Charlie Puth & Robert Gillies]
Breaking both our, breaking both our
Breaking both our hearts
Though I'd rather hold you close
I've just gotta let you fly away
Bluebird, fly away

My baby
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again

Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking us apart

You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect 
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart

[Instrumental][Verse 1]
I took her out to dinner
I thought I'd had a winner
And what happened next came to a surprise to be
So I walked her to her front door
Waiting for what I had hoped for
But then she hugged and said goodnight to me
As I took my bad, stepped off that porch, I saw a friend of mine
She stepped closer then grabbed my hand and met me eye to eye

[Chorus]
That's when she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!

[Verse 2]
So I took her down to the shoreline
The weather that day was so fine
And not to mention she looked pretty good too
And later at the movies, romantic comedy
I hate those films but for her I managed to get through
I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes
As I desperately tried to say something she put her finger on my lip and said one more thing

[Chorus]
She kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!

[Bridge]
It's nice to know that she cares enough about me
I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming
And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same
About that other girl's name

[Chorus]
Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa![Intro]
Aw yeah
What 
I have a little story to tell you
And it goes like this

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street, bitch, walking down the street
Walking down the street with shoes at my feet
But then I saw a glimpse from the corner of my eye
I saw this smokin' hot broad walk by

I said, "Yo baby, what's up ", She said "you talkin' to me "
"Well, duh, there's no one else on the street"
"You're coming back to my place" This how it's gonna be
But then something hit my face

[Chorus]
Who threw this pickle at me 
Who threw this pickle at me 
Can't you see I'm tryna mack this bitch 
Who threw this pickle at me 

Who threw this pickle at me 
Who threw this pickle at me 
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosher

[Verse 2]
The next day, nothing's new
Sitting on this seat like I always do
Saw them other bitches walkin' my way
"Man  I need a bagel"

Eating at the deli with my bagel and jelly
While I'm observing the trees
Gosh, how did they get so green and plump 
Wait, what just hit my face  Oh my 

[Chorus]
Who threw this pickle at me 
Who threw this pickle at me 
Can't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel 
Who threw this pickle at me 

Who threw this pickle at me 
Who threw this pickle at me 
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosher[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
(Ay) What you thinking 
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)
You say you're leaving
Well, if you wanna leave, there ain't nobody stopping you
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please"
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

[Post Chorus: Kehlani & (Charlie Puth)]
Tell me what you've done for me
(Tell me what you've done for me)
Tell me what you've done for me

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
I never cheated
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Charlie Puth]
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please" (oh no, I won't say, "Please")
I won't fall to the ground on my knees (on my knees)
You know I've given this everything (oh, oh)
Baby honestly, (baby honestly), baby honestly (whoa)

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

Tell me what you've done for me
(Tell me what you've done for me)
Tell me what you've done for me
(tell me what you've done for me)
(tell me what you've done for me)[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for 
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charile Puth]
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus] :
You just want attention, you don't want my heart

[Verse 1]
Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide (oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

Maybe I don't go out anymore (oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)

'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

Oh-oh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo

[Verse 1]
I m sitting here alone again
Waiting for you to come see me now
As time passes by
In the blink of an eye
I know I ll get to see you somehow

You are sitting home another night
Waiting for someone to hold you tight
Time passes by
So quick indeed
This time you re slipping away from me

It s been a long, cold, hard winter
It was a long, drawn-out spring
You took no wrong when you saw nothing in me
But our love was something nice to see

[Verse 2]
We were sitting alone on the beach
Letting all the sand between our feet
As time passes by
Blink of an eye
Amazing how things ain t what they used to be
Ain t what they used to be...

It was the shortest summer
The fall was so abrupt
Thought you d be happy with the way things were
But I guess it wasn t enough

[Verse 3]
I am outside sitting, writing this song
You could have guessed that all along
Time passed me by
So quick indeed
And you re the only thing that I m missing

I wrote this song all last night
Tried to make the lyrics fit just right
But I m still having trouble with this very last part
But I know it ll come from my heart
But I know it ll come from my heart...

[Outro]
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo[Verse 1]
I see the people all the time
Counting all their dimes
Walking around living one big lie
I bet they all go far
Driving those rented cars
Going around in circles hoping that you'll see them

[Bridge]
You say you're quintessential
You say you're something special
But it's time to move on
And get on with your life

[Chorus]
Everybody (everybody)
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
(oooh yeah it's not all about the wealth)

[Final Chorus]
And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else

[Verse 2]
I hear them talking everyday
The purchases they made
Hiding their faces with those fake designer shades

(Yeah)

They say their doing well
But they should take a look at themselves
Theres gotta be something in their life they know thats missing

[Bridge]
You say you're quintessential

Alright
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl 
Can't you blame my head and not my heart 
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on 
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on 
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She said "Boy, tell me honestly"
"Was it real or just for show ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on 
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on 
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh (yeah)

Oooh-ooh-oh
How long has this been goin' on, baby 
Ooo-oh (yeah)

Oooh-ooh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on 
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"

You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Post-Chorus]

(Oooh-ooh-oh)
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
