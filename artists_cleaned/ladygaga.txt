I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (Yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (Yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape (Oh)
All of the crazy shit (Let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing (Girl)

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin  the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind (My mind)
But do what you want with my body (Yeah)
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (Body)

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (You)
But do what you want with my body
(What I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place 
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2]
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place 
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)

Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)[Verse 1]
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

[Outro]
I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay[Intro]

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital "H-I-M" (M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way

Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover 
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover 
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura 
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover 
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover 
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura 
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura 

[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans 
Does this thing we have even makes sense 
When I got the whole world in front of me "
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other "
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

Velvet ropes and guitars, yeah, 'cause you're my rock star
In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me

Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

But something s pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to

Too lit, tonight, prayin'

Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission

He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

Put on a show tonight, do whatever you like

If you're a strong female
You don't need permission

[Verse 2]
Love is objectified by what men say is right
Schei e, schei e be mine, bullshit be mine
Blonde high-heeled feminists, enlisting femmes for this
Express your womankind, fight for your right (Fight for your right)

Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and 12 lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"

Feelin' something that I can't explain (Oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (Oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (Oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Verse 2]
You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell

[Pre-Chorus]
What happens now  I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay 

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
It s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I m back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something,  bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
It s been two years since I let you go
I couldn t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
"Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(There's something), something about this place
(Something), something,  bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

[Final Chorus: Lady Gaga & Brian May]
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you[Verse 1]
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Verse 2]
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Bridge]
Brushes of darkness won't help you create Your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Outro]
Free my mind
ARTPOP
You make my
Heart stop[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl 
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl 

[Verse 2]
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl 
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl 

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl 
Girl
Where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl [Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
(Not another word from you)
You're just an animal, trying to act real special
(But deep down you're just a shrew)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya  I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

[Drop]
Swine! Swine!

[Verse 2]
Be that hog, sweat it out, you squealer
(Let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle
(It's the thrill of ecstasy)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya  I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

[Drop]
Swine!

[Outro]
Paint your face and
Paint his face and catch the beat
Paint your face and
Paint her face and catch the beat
Paint your face and
Be a swine just catch the beat
For the weekend
Catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Huh huh
C-catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Swine![Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh

Oh

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips

[Outro: Bradley Cooper]
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again
Never love again
Oh I'll never love again[Verse 1]
Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel

Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the trick who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

Open-minded, I'm so blinded
Mystery man, woman phantom
Violet light smears the atmosphere
I'm so scared, but I'm standing here

[Pre-Chorus]
Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign 
Is it all just virtual 

[Chorus]
We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma

[Verse 2]
Can't stop staring, I'm so naked
Wrapped in shadows, my heart races
Dragon's eyes watch, goddess breathing
Give me something to believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign 
Is it all just virtual 

[Chorus]
We could be lovers, even just tonight

Did you hear what I said  (Yeah)
Is it all in my head

We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight

Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute

The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl, and a (huh) and a game
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
A lovegame!

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame 
Are you in the game 
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame 
Are you in the game 
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame 
Are you in the game 
(Let's have some fun, this beat is sick)
Dans, the lovegame
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame 
Are you in the game 
(Don't think too much, just bust that kick)
Dans, the lovegame
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Dans, the lovegame[Verse 1]
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Bridge]
I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying (Doves)[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright 
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partna
Yup, leggo

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands and bills
Came up from 'round, that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal, 'bout 60 mill
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah, wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you've surveyed the way we ve acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Everybody want that money, what you want
High as hell, trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks
Bitch!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs,  play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[iTunes Festival: Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

[Chorus 1]
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Verse 2]
Under the foggy day
I m lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can t get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

[Chorus 2]
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Bridge]
When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can t believe it won t believe it
Uh

[Chorus 3]
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart

Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'

Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
And this dance is on you

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could we fix you if you broke 
And is your punch line just a joke 

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Verse 2]
I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Bridge]
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up  Could I give it all up for you 
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up 
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you 
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)

[Chorus 2]
So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again 
Oh, boy, why you so speechless  (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Outro]
Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless 
Oh-oh-oh-oh[Intro]
Money
Oh

[Verse 1]
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

[Post-Chorus]
Love

[Verse 2]
We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir toute seule

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it
You can try to fake it
But baby, I laced it

Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

Tap down those boots while I beat around

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
(call your name out, call your name out)

Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin' 

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry

I'm gonna marry the night
I won t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night

[Bridge]
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love
Come on run
Turn the car on and run

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead

By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won t walk away, but she won t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess

The moon lights her way while she s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she s a tramp
She s a tramp, she s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She s a tramp, she s a vamp, but she still kills the dance

I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Verse 2]
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Bridge]
I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold[Verse 1]
I was 23
She was 35

And she was so alive
A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this drunk song
So when I start to bawl
She says, "let your teardrops fall"

When I stare at you, I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go

Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away
I'll turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

[Pre-Chorus]
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

You see the best in me

I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

Would you still love me if I gave it all up just to cry 
Would you still love me 
Would, would you still love me right 
Would you still need me if I didn't t-tell you goodbye 
Would you still love me 
Would, would you still love me right 

[Verse 2]
Take my picture from me
And imagine what I'd do
I know what's best for me
Tryna do what's best for you
This could all be fiction
I know that it sounds taboo
I wear my heart on my sleeve
It's making its debut

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself

I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

[Outro]
Cherry cherry, boom boom
Eh-eh, hey
Oh yeah, all I can say is "eh-eh""The Prelude Path tique"- First Part:
When I look back on my life it s not that I don t want to see things exactly as they happened, it s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It s not that I have been dishonest; it s just that I loathe reality

For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring

Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam

The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears

"The Prelude Path tique"- Last Part:
You may say "I lost everything". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again[Verse 1]
Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me, before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want any paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

[Verse 2]
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I ve heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
'Til your diamond words melted into some ice
You shoulda been rappin' to the beat of my song
Mr. Californ-ia, paper ganster-a
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you ve been played"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta)
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta

Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta

We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
Till they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Verse 2]
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Bridge]
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby

[Outro]
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby[Verse: Lady Gaga]
When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found[Instrumental][Intro]
It's in time with it

[Verse 1]
In your brown eyes, I walked away
In your brown eyes, I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong 

[Chorus 1]
If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

[Verse 2]
In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'Cause the brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on
Play that song

[Chorus 1]
Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
Brown eyes

[Chorus 2]
Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix, and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey, yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes

[Outro]
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Got some brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes[Verse 1]
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Verse 2]
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place

It's off, it's on
The party's just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Verse 2]
Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
And I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
This one's for you[Verse 1]
I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is
Runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be
Retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the...

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby 
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is
Pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something
I wanna see
Television, and hot blondes in odd positions

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby 
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Bridge]
Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time
Fame, fame
Doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
I'll need someone to love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Break]
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 3]
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

The final act of life will be my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love

Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

[Verse 2]
She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads, with a flag in her bra

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

Enter that cash flow

So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars 
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

I like it rough

[Verse 1]
Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me's like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough

And when I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in

I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene

There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind

[Verse 1]
We got a redlight
Pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey
But we got no money
Our hair is perfect while we're all getting shit-wrecked
It's automatic, honey
But we got no money

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy, I'm so sorry
I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah

Like to p-p-party, yeah

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich, bang, bang)

[Verse 2]
We live a cute life
Sound-fanatic
Pants tighter than plastic, honey
But we got no money
We do the dance right
We have got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song

[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves[Verse 1]
Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

[Verse 2]
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen

[Bridge]
Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Love it when my man smells so good

I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

[Verse 2]
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy  I...

[Verse 1]
Damn, I love the Jag, the jet, and the mansion
Oh, yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's good to live expensive, you know it, but
My knees get weak, intensive

[Chorus]
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

[Post-Chorus]
That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy  I...

Oh, yeah
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh, yeah

It's good to live expensive, you know it, but
My knees get weak, intensive

Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

[Bridge]
You know I 'preciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby
(I can do without it, babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby

[Breakdown]
K-k-k-k-kisses

[Verse 1]
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz 
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think

[Pre-Chorus]
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high

In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Verse 2]
I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there 
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored 
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Bridge]
I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk 
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Outro]
It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders  Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong 
Has our young courage faded 

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired down the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around 

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders  Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl 
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl 

[Verse 2]
If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice  gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl 
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl 

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl 
Girl, where do you think you're goin' 
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl

Get back, bunny
It's getting cold in here, little honey
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax
Cupid's got me, oh, with his bow and arrow, baby
He'll hit you in the pants, hot pants
Get the people to dance and relax, relax

Throw it like those girls in the movies
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax

A 300 mirror's burning through the hearts of the crowd
In the back hips just banging the track to the muzak, muzak

Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)

You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there 
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time[Hook]
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingu  traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

[Bridge]
Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
And the thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too[Verse 1]
I'm calling 'cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know how good I can be
I'm calling just to tell you
Get here, I'll make it all worth your while
I can make you some food
Boy, and then I can make you smile

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

[Verse 2]
You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

[Bridge]
When you get here, boy, we can dance
My hands in the back pockets of your pants
I've turned the lights down low
And I've got nothing on but the radio

[Breakdown]
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight (oh-oh, nothing)
Nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A.T, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place... the birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, "How can I protect something so perfect without evil "[Verse 1]
I can t help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars 
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

[Post-Chorus]
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man 
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans 
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

[Verse 2]
I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars

Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love 
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man 
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans 
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

[Bridge]
Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes
My future guy

I woke up chained inside a vacant little room
Felt like a prisoner of his discretion
I couldn t breathe my lungs were captured by the fumes
My mind was in the arms of his possession

[Pre-Chorus]
Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I m living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I ve been Frankensteined

(Don t call me Gaga
I m not that girl anymore)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could think about the soul I used to be
But it s a waste because our time is precious
And as I traveled through the graveyards underneath
Felt like a queen but I m a crooked princess

[Pre-Chrous]
Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster
I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life life,life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I m living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I ve been Frankensteined

[Bridge]
The night is young but my spirit s even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit s even younger
I can taste the hunger
The night is young but my spirit s even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit s even younger
Can you taste the hunger

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor he went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life, life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I m living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I ve been Frankensteined
I ve been Frankensteined

Now I m finally alive
I ve been Frankensteined[Intro]

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I didn't ask for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me

[Verse 2]
I didn't ask for the daylight
'Cause I was born for the night, and it changed my life
I knew the hurt wouldn't be small
You said you'd love me forever, but you don't call

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery

We love each other so deeply
That I ask you, the sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever, never to part

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye[Intro]
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought, baby, you were done
'Cause for a while, you could barely look at me
This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past (Oh, oh babe)
Cannot forget the past (Oh, oh)
Still, baby...

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around

[Verse 2]
We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides, baby, by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed 
Last time, we were hangin' out
You were acting kind of estranged
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry, now it's me that feels this way
(My heart just keeps on turning)
It's me that feels this way, babe (Oh, oh babe)
And now you are the one that is hurting

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

[Bridge]
I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around[Intro]

Bang bang, that awful sound

Bang bang, he hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
My baby shot me down[Chorus]

Trying to get up that great big hill of hope

That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
Or whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lie in my bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I"am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on 
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
I say hey, what's going on 
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
Yah yah yah hiya
I say hey, what's going on 
Ooh, ooh ooh
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs

Nothing wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty  cause this country s insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don t mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don t get too attached
This is a brief affair

[Chorus]

We re covered in sequins, diamonds
We're happy  cause we're shining

It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rockstar's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it s alright, baby, I'm nobody s mother
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

[Verse 2]
It s been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It s alright, baby."
I'm nobody s mother
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes

Hot shit in Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride is good looking, good looking
He tells that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy

He's always with his car, car, car

What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me 

[Verse]
How could you ever let me go 
How could you ever, ever let me go 
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

[Chorus]
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Verse 1]
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame

[Verse 2]
Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can t believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you re wondering if I m staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 3]
Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there s no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

[Verse 4]
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn t real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won t allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can t believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you re wondering if I m staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Bridge]
Get your things and go
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can t believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you re wondering if I m staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay[Verse 1]
She does a dirty dance
To a song about a bad romance
Meet a damaged girl, meet a damaged guy
He's a local star, stealing glares of her across the bar
See a damaged girl, see a damaged guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

[Chorus]
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
They were neighbours then
Back then, they wer n't even friends
Watch a damag d girl, watch a damaged guy
Fearing stories when a couple crashed, dangerous affair
Watching them tear up, the DJ cries, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
Hey, hey, hey

If I fell in love with you, would you understand me, dear 
Love is weird
I colored you a valentine
Struggled just to stay inside the lines
I lose my mind

Wonderful, 'cause I am

Ate a slice of cherry pie

On a bench inside the park
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark
I'll never stop

Time is nothing but a line
We leave everything behind
It'd be so wonderful, wonderful

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above

This land is your land, this land is my land
This land was made for you and me

One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all...

(Just, just dance)
(Let's play a love game, play a love game)
(Papa-paparazzi)

I'm on the edge!

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please -

Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby -
Stay with me
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face

Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today

Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say, say 
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh 
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kind of busy

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to think anymore!
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to talk anymore!
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys  I lost my phone, phone
What's going on on the floor 
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club 
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-da
Just dance, spin that record, babe
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh
Dance, dance, dance, just j-j-just dance

How you doing tonight, Texas 
America...World...how you doing tonight 
We're here to make you feel good. You wanna feel good with us 

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey Dad, Hey Mom.

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one...tell me that you'll be the good one... why don't you...stay, stay, stay

Super Bowl 51![Verse 1]
Smile though your heart is breaking
Smile even though it's aching
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

[Verse 2]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying 
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Narration]
So, as you can tell I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse, so I added one extra one
Here it goes...

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Snowman
With the carrot nose and charcoal eyes
And oh, when he cries, I'm going to tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh, and on his way
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
So may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright
And may all your Christmases be whiteThis is the manifesto of Mother Monster:

On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil

And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered,  How can I protect something so perfect without evil  [Snippet of lyrics released on Twitter]

...It's been oolong since I've had a sip
And I get this feeling I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight....

Pull the trigger I'm ready it's showtime![Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think I should settle down or that we could just be friends
"Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
But then we, we kissed all night as his mission beach party
And I said

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
I'm packing bags and making stacks
Like a good old time American
And I'm just tryna show my mom and dad
There's such thing as a real good man
Cause when he talks to me, you see the man that you're talking about as I see
When he puts my hand over his bathing suit
Says to me...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other "
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Doesn't matter if your daddy gets pissed
It's you and me

[Refrain]
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian combined

I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen 

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth

For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The fame won't change us if we don't let it

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ruled the world
Ruled the world[Intro]

Who's that girl 
Running round with no clothes on
Heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity
Who's that girl 
She's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair

It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Verse 2]
I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
 Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place 
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus:]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams

We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
( Cause I'm broken)

Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy so were you
When we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
Sine in the times to the cry of a 1000 doves

I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

Babe when you re under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we could not forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you ve been haunting me

Before I let you go
Something that you should know
Can t say that I was wrong but
Babe it has been so long

I m not the kind to admit
Babe when you re under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we could not forget[Verse 1]
One look, and I'm done
One glance from your eyes, and I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken, and I...

[Chorus 1]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you

[Verse 2]
You're just like the wind
'Cause everything moves away when you're around it
The sun is just like the sound of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up, and I...

[Chorus 2]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm never jaded
I'm captivated

[Bridge]
Oh, I'll never stop believing in this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar, hold me closer and make me sweeter
I need you
I love you

So, please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness, and I...

[Chorus 3]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
It's been so long, but now I've waited
And I'm captivated[Verse 1]
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do 
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Bridge]
Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you

Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end

And when I'll finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day

Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down
Can't let love down

[Verse 1]
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the radio, that's my dream
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio, they won't tear me apart

10 steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me
On the road, road paved in gold

So...let's do Orange Colored Sky
Yeah 
I used to sing this at the Oak Room with my buddies
Woo! It's getting windy

[Verse 1]
I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam
I got a look at you

[Chorus]
Oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
 Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

[Verse 2]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky


[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"

This is it, this is it

[Verse 3]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polkadot sky
Wham, bam, alakazam
And gone, bye

All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons

[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons

He went to them, they turned away
He just wanted something to eat, a place to love, a place to pray
In God we trust, and it's okay
He said, "I'm black, latin, and gay...
I went to them, they turned away."

[Pre-Chorus]
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace

We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed

Nineteen, moved to the big city to find a dream, to find a way
Ooh, burning concrete of lower east

Passionately only serving him, yeah

What do you say we get outta here kid 

[Verse 1]
One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said ''we can't stand still"
One trick bunny and a haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said ''hey love child, take me back''
I said ''we can't stand still"

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

[Verse 2]
Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said ''I can't stand still"
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said ''It's been so long since we got down''
He said ''I can't stand still''

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual

[Bridge]
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
What do you saw  Get outta here kid!

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)
Feel so retrosexual, sexual, sexual, sexual

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay[Verse 1]
Where did they go 
Where did everybody go 
I wanna know

We could've tried
Why did everybody cry if you weren't mine 

[Chorus]
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love 
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well

Can't find the words
But hey, man, everybody hurts
When it doesn't work

Your love drowned us in a hole
You never ever wanted her to grow
To grow
Oh, oh
Why

[Chorus]
If everything is gonna change, was it worth it 
Oh, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love 
You weren't strong enough, oh well, for me...
Oh well
Oh well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well

Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

In the white room, with the yellow chair
Was her baby, with his angry stare
In the white room, through their violet eyes
Shes just a baby taken by surprise

They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a--ding

In the white room, she had jet black hair
She held his head down, but he left her there
In the white room, you could hear their cries
Sound of a baby heard his very first lie

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars

"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

        [Verse 1]
We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

[Verse 2]
Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

This next song is called "The Edge of Glory", and I really wanted to play it for everyone tonight because it's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him. So, here it is, this is "The Edge of Glory"
So grandma, if you're watching at home, this song's for you

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Break: Spoken]
One of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma right around Thanksgiving, and it's actually leading up to Christmas time, is that they make these cookies called pizzelle's. If you're Italian, you know what those are. They're like really flat waffles, but they're really thin and crisp. My grandpa would always make the pizzelle and would always work the machine, and everybody had to "I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way". That was my grandfathers thing, he made the pizzelle's, so I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about the Italian cookies

[Verse 2]
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, I know your dancin' the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment
Baby, with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you[Spoken Intro]

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, oh yeah
Just the brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people sharing in the world
With nothing to hate, and nothing to think
Just people to love, and friends to have drinks

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
Oh-oh, yeah
And the world will live as one[Verse 1]
We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes
Yeah, we're banking on us

Fashion sense and vanity consume us, 'cause we...

For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life 
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"

[Refrain]
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win

But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

*does chorexo*[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong "
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art s in pop culture, in me

[Verse 1]
You make me feel so pretty
When I'm not feeling so cool today
Yeah, you pull me out when you know that I'm afraid
Something about you
It dries up every tear in my way
And when I trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me, babe
'Cause you're my cowboy, you're my everything
And you know how to get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl  you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I ask myself these questions
About you that I cannot explain
How you ride with me when you know that I'm to blame
You've proved your love
I don't need to hear the words that you say
But I know you say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And my worries become yesterday
Baby, you get me

Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground

Oh baby

We've got music tonight
We're gonna make it happen this time, this time
Lets get physical
Ride her like a bicycle, baby
Oh babyAfter one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Oh I lost my heart, but what of it 
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
Bewitched! Bothered! And bewildered, am I[Spoken Monologue]
When I was younger, I was at some point, born.
I grew in both IQ and EQ and as that happened I discovered that I was living in two realities at once.
They fought all the time and yet I made space for both of them for a reason I can't explain.
One reality I experienced was my Earth reality. The day, today, painting of what I was taught was my natural state in life.
At the time I also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my Earth reality at all times.
A vision where I perform my thoughts for the world, a world where I mattered in a different way.
A world where I was valued for different things.
And in this world I was kind and that kindness spread through people, through sound.
This was the birth of Chromatica.

Love is an element on Chromatica, like earth, wind, fire, water.
It's a natural force and it's the only way that I can organize this super organism that is the Earth, it's by making it one whole thing.
Where time and linear structure don't matter, they don't exist.
We are all love.
I am love.
So it's everything around us.
It's how we work.
It's the thing we both initiate and respond to.
It's why everything happens, both good and bad.
It's the only way that I can make things simple.
And why shouldn't it be simple 
I breathe in and out love.
I don't believe it to be a choice other than I choose to breathe.
That is Chromatica.
It is how I do hard things.
It's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life.
No one thing is greater than another.
Kindness rules all things.
It simply is and it's mine.
You can have it too, though.
My best friend says "Sharing is caring" but we both know that I don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care.

The Manifesto of Chromatica it's never-ending, I cannot finish it here.
It would be declaring I would never make music or be Lady Gaga again, which would mean I would stop being myself.
This manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life.
One where I acknowledge that sound is my life force and that Lady Gaga is the mystery that carries it.
Chromatica can't end, it's how I make sense of things.
That's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is.
And for what is worth I think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd.The full lyrics of the song will be available soon[Intro]

When I wrote this song many years ago I said I wish that I could dance on one single prayer
I wish I could be strong without permission
But it s a really strange thing, strength
 Cause you gotta know what weakness feels like to have it
You gotta put up with some bull s*
So you know, I wrote about a nice sentiment about strength, and being a woman in this very sentimental song

Alcjandro !Hold her hand through the black light
Baby, it's a forest land of trick slides
Honey just take your time close her eyes

"I'm scared", she whispered as she runs to hide
Into a back room where she paints on a smile
She hears a sound, she hears a sound

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So she left town with the rockshow

Keep it cool at the freakshow
Baby, it's a happy place; if you lose it, honey
Just take your time, close his eyes

"Touch me", he whispered as he walks to the light
From the window, there's visions of a house in the night
He hears a sound, he hears a sound

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So she left town with the rockshow

Hold her, tell her that you need her
Please undress her slowly, uh-oh
Never hold the girl too tightly
She can't breathe when you speak
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
We waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So we left town with the rockshow
Rock show, rock show, rockshow[Pre-Verse]

I know where you were last night
I saw you with your hands on her
Rubbin' her like you love her more than me
And I cannot believe
What's she got that I don't 
Know how you could pass up
A night with me to drive 'round homegirl
When I've got a body you can feel
Boy she's not even real
Don't lie to me 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car 
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car )
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)

[Verse 2]
You stayed home to repaint her
When I could use a hot wax, personal manicure
I need attention too
So you might have to choose
'Cause I can't take it
When I know that I'm more fine
And I got the interior love and it's genuine
My trunk is just as round
And I'll never break down
Babe, it's not fair that

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car 
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car )
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car 
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car )
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)[Verse 1]
I still see your coat hanging on the door
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me why I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Post-Chorus]
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Verse 2]
You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wish I could try, but I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on

Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Bridge]
Cause the ground is breaking
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking
Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (hold)

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
(Just-just gotta-gotta hold)

[Prolude]
Only got one life to live
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and...

We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on
And hold on, and hold on

All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys 
I lost my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor 
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club 
I can't remember, but it's alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out 
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor 
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club 
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay

I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth

No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
That fountain of truth

The future is yours
The time is now
The place is here
Shout now
So every kid can hear
So every woman and man in the land can understand the new world
Inherited by the children
Free from famine or disease
That's right
Free from the gun and the knife
Forever, for life
Free from all the mistakes that we made in the past
Throw your hands in the air and let the truth last

The wind in every hour
To blossom like a flower under the rain shower
The reach like the branch of the tree up in the sky
So reach high and soar with the eagles as we fly
Flight of great heights
Fight the great fights
Strong and sing songs of wrongs just made right
And the never ending search for the fountain of youth
In your youth you're bound to find a fountain of truth

[Lady Gaga]:
I've looked in the city
A place without pity
Seen mountains of wealth
Not fountains of health

Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)
You can t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (you)
But do what you want with my body
(When I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

Sirens are screaming
And I'm losin' control!
Someone turned out
The lights in musicland
But the record starts to spin
I feel the music and
We start to dance, yeah!Never seen so many purple clouds

But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know I

Something 'bout you and me
Is made of steam, a little mean
But I prefer us both that way

I spin U around

Tonight, I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong (A-P-P-L-A-U)
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong " (A-P-P-L-A-U)
If only fame had an IV

Being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks" (A-P-P-L-A-U)
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read (A-P-P-L-A-U)
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me (A-P-P-L-A-U)

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Post-Chorus]
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Post-Chorus]
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather

[Bridge]
Oh, every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders  Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred 
Why do we pretend we're wrong 
Has our young courage faded 

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around 

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders  Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

*gets guitar*
*sits*

We re very honored tonight that my latest album  Joanne  is number 8 in United States. Thank you! :)

And I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don t worry about it, it s not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don t know who Joanne is 
Oh. I think many people are a bit lost
But, if you do know who Joanne is, that s amazing
And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who s Joanne  *laughs*
And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents
But Joanne, was also the name of my father s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus
This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table
I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father
So when I asked of all of you tonight, it s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know
And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky
And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much
So much that you don t even remember who you were before

For me, that pain has only one name, and it s Joanne

*whispers* one, two, three
*plays guitar*

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven s not ready for you 

Girl, where do you think you re going, where do you think you re going, going girl 
Girl, where do you think you re going! Girl


We both know, things don t work that way
I promised I, wouldn t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you re going 

Honestly I know where you re going

And I ll still love you even if I can t see you anymore. Can t wait to see you soar

Joanne middle stop speech:
Hello gentlemen
I guess what I m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself
I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home

*sits*
*whispers* one, two, three

*plays guitar*

Girl, where do you think you re going, where do you think you re going, going girl!
Girl, where do you think you re going, where do you think you re going, going, gi-oh-rl!

Call me Joanne

Xo Joanne

XoXo all our pain, makes us this way, it made me who I am

When they're young
All Little Monsters
Learn that they're scary
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid
Overweight & hairy

But every Monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into
Sexy, Mr. Hyde

[Chorus]
All my Monsters are beautiful
Disco Stutiful
Square rootiful
Old cutiful

Monsters don't need implants

The Monsters, that they are

And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down

Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I want to see you there tonight
If you're not, I'm Lady-Gaga-fierce, who kills people who don't come to my show, whoo!

I'm the CEO of fierceness, whoo!

You're very good at reading my mind
But you've messed with me so many times

[Bridge: Lady Gaga + (Doja Cat)]
I'm up in space (Up in space)
Where everybody lives on the fierce planet place
Nobody's stoppin' me from showin' off my fierceness tonight, whoo!

People ask me if the fame makes me lonely. And I tell them, No, I m not lonely. Because when I meet my hotel room by myself I can still hear you cheering me there when I close my eyes
When I wrote this album, I wanted to create something full of joy. A celebration, something that took all my mess and all my pain and turned it into the most beautiful schizophrenic psychedelic dance. Full of color, loud electronic music
The most outrageous fashion, something nearly impossible to follow, like my heart, like my mind
Something I couldn t keep control of
Sometimes we constantly run away from ourselves to keep up with the universe. But with this album I felt free
And if you love ARTPOP then you have no idea how we are so similar
Thank you
So, as much as I enjoy performing this show, laughs Are you saying something 
*gets on her knees* Hello! Oh, my hair! *gets up*
I enjoy performing this show for you every night and I hope that you loved it
Everybody watching on Yahoo, we love you. Everybody here in Paris, we love you
But I d wish to tell you something. I know we ve put up a show, and, I have the most amazing dancers, the most amazing band, the most incredible crew. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew for this whole tour, I lcve you so much. But, the real show

The real show every night is the one in the audience. You are so full of passion, so full of freedom
So please, my sweet little monsters, in the most non-traditional of request, I the performer, ask you to accept our deepest applause *smiles*

[Intro]
You were spectacular! A masterpiece Paris! I couldn t take my eyes of you for a second!
An absolute sensation across the talent! Put your hands up make  em touch!

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong!
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong "
If only fame had an IV
Bcby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks" *walk and make move voice*
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read!
One second I'm a kunst, then suddenly the kunst is me
Pop culture was in art, now art s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and SCREAM FOR ME!
LETS GO CMON !

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine!
Act like a swine!

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body

I hope that you always remember this time in our lives together
When we painted each others faces, and called each other monsters. And talked about love, and art, all night long
Every year, when I travel around the world, I always wonder if things will be different. Maybe one year you won t come to the show. Or you ll be less festive or, not dressed up or, something different
But what I realised, during ARTPOP, is that we belong together and some stories have no end
I will follow you, around the world, as long as you have me
Because I love making music, I love making art. And I love, love meeting all of you beautiful creative people
When this song is over, the clock will start ticking, until  the next time

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends..
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans 
Does this thing we have even makes sense 
When I got the whole world in front of me "

I appreciate you so much. Thank you for believing in, in me always. I ll always believe in you
When I die, they ll say:  Lady Gaga was special. But her fans, her monsters, they were really something. 

[Chorus 1]
So, I said...
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gcpsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
Taylor, im coming home! *smile*
But I can be..
COME ON!!
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
PUT YOUR HANDS UP !
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home!

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever

"Baby, why do we love each other "
I said, "Honey, it's simple !
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight

Hey...

Thank you so much! We love you
May the clock start ticking, monsters, till next time *smiles*Stephen Fry: I know people talk to you about all the same things but one of the things I just wanted to talk to you about, because it s so obvious coming here, is the thing I think that you always say is most important to you, which is the fans, and they re all outside and I gather you took them out some hot chocolate 

Lady Gaga: Actually, well, I sent them hot chocolate yesterday and macaroons, and then today I had press all day and I felt bad because I usually would leave the hotel and I would go to say  hi  but I knew that I wouldn t have time and they d be waiting all day, so I just went down and I brought them some fresh cookies and flowers.

SF: Ooooh! And do you find there s a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity: is there a kind of Gaga fan who has a commonality 

LG: Yes, there is. The little monsters are a community and it s kind of nice that everywhere I go they create a little home for me.

SF: Both those who, I suppose, describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you, as I do I m unashamed to say, would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed, the marginal, the freakish, the outsider, the sexually different, the ugly, the fat, the one who doesn t fit in, the one who feels outside the tribe, if you like.

LG: Yes, it could be anybody.
SF: Which, in fact, is most of us. None of us really feels we belong, just some of us are better at hiding it than others.
LG: I think so. Some of us wear the mask prouder than others.
SF: Yes. Exactly. And the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that, I suppose, Born This Way and the title song of it.
LG: Yes. The album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life.
SF: Oh, so it s not just that God made me gay or God made me lesbian or God made me bi, and that s who I am 
LG: No.
SF: It s about being reborn, is it 
LG: No, not really.[Lana Del Rey]
Chromatica, she must go.
The Mantra has ceased, the pain has healed.

This is my Exodus.
From the suffering that has plagued me for years.
This is my Exodus.Listen
I've got the sickest ambition
Deep in the mirror I am scared
Don't know who the hell is there
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection

Obsession
It's the thing, it's our new religion
Each model and celebrity
Changes how I look at me
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me
I'll never be

A superstar 'cause I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood
In Hollywood, In Hollywood

Women
Let's talk about our condition
Now beauty's a commodity
Nip and tuck your fantasy
But your better live with your revisions

I have a vision
It's a world without these decisions
Sure Hollywood's commercially
Glamorous but naturally's the way to be
And you can't tell me I'm not sexy

I'm a superstar, And I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood

You know I could
Hollywood, Hollywood

Oh within a year I know I could
Oh look like a girl in Hollywood
Oh a superstar, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood

I could
Hollywood

Hollywood, Hollywood

Within the year I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Like superstars, yeah I know I could

To make a pure love work in a dirty way

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings!

Your destiny of self, but ARTP*P could mean anything, anything.. ! SING IT WITH ME!!! *plays*

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

Ooh, there ain't no other way

With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I m not leaving without you

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body

You can't have my heart (help me now) and you won't use my mind

Do what you want with my body

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons

It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

[Post-Chorus: Valeria]
Lick me, slap me, do it, do it
Do me right, there's nothing to itI know that you all have been feeling a tremendous range of emotions. Since we've all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I can't help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let's all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they're fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone. Tomorrow I hope that we all raise thoughtfully and loudly towards solutions. But tonight and right now, Orlando, we are united with you and we are here to remember.

Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases

Almost like I have no choice

Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)

The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard b fore

My heart will be bl ssed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

[Verse 2]
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3]
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever

There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life

So I heard there was a rally here a couple weeks ago
I heard that a million very right wing conservative people spoke out against gay marriage in France
F those F people
Those people do not represent the true perspective of this country. They are extremely conservative, extremely right-wing, and all that we have to do, all that you have to do is be louder than them
Because you are on the right side of history, you are on the side of love, the side of acceptance, the side of tolerance
So don t you let them bring you down, don t you let them think they re setting you back  cause they re not, they re just a F bunch of winey b*s
I don t mean that as fighting words but, you know, it s 2014 and people are getting together

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We're all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, la France you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital "H"im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this friends and
Mi amore vole fe yah! yeah-ah!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes!
I'm on the right track, baby
*point mic*
Don't hide yourself
*point mic*
*plays*

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way!
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way

[Pause]
So, if you are living in France, whether you re young, or old, or in the middle, if you re gay, hold your head up high and be F proud and live your life
And if anybody here feels uncomfortable with this conversation you probably shouldn t have come to this concert. Here we spread love with every invention that we make. You don t have to feel invisible, you don t have to feel like you don t matter

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life! *hold notes*
Your on the right track, baby
You are born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige

(Verse 1 Madonna)
Girl on the screen, look at me
I never would have guessed that we'd be friends
Oh, but you don't want to be seen with me
I wanna see what you see
We're living in a world that's full of hate
Oh, but you don't care what they say
Do you 

(Chorus)
Down the subway, you looked my way With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls

(Verse 2 Gaga)

New York Girls little let down, but I'm not dead
There's a little bit more that has to be said (oh, oh) You play me, now I play you too
Let's just call it over

(Chorus 2)

Down the subway, you looked my way With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls

(Bridge Gaga, Madonna)

Scared to keep the lights on when I kiss you Slowly
Kissing you slowly
Does that mean that you're afraid to look at Real eyes baby

(Chorus 3, Ending)

Down the subway, you looked my way With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls

[Verse 2]
It s been two years since I let you go

Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me Neil Young "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I m not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh
(spoken)
And you know I put on some country clothes the other day and said I was voting for Joe 'cause I wear cabellas when I'm on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania. And I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. So this is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other
