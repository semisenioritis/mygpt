[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (Eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (Eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazy (Okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call  Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden  (Huh )
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit (Wooh)
The red light, red light stop, stop (Skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage (Carriage)

Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you "no", but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

[Outro]
I dunno
Whatever[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try 
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two  (yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Wiz Khalifa]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two  (For two )
(Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out 
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for 
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for 
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use 
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye[Directed by David Dobkin]

[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please (Your sugar, yes please)
Won't you come and put it down on me 

[Bridge]
Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please (Please)
Won't you come and put it down on me  (Down on me)
I'm right here, 'cause I need (I'm right here, 'cause I need)

Your sugar, yes please (Your sugar, yes please)
Won't you come and put it down on me 
(Down on me, down on me, ooh)[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away 

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you 
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you 
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you 
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you 
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah

Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Christina Aguilera)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile 
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (Yeah, yeah)
You want the moves like Jagger

Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom P rignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (A$AP Rocky)]
Leaves are fallin', it's September (oh)
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey[Verse 1]
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on 
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast 

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Verse 2]
Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Bridge]
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Outro]
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa[Verse 1]
You keep me connected to you like I was your shadow
You're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
Just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners, oh
The neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
Baby, when I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Bridge]
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular (Whoo!)
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker[Verse 1]
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Verse 2]
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me  Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me  Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me  Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me  Yeah

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Outro]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back[Intro]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone 
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try 
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 
If happy ever after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone  Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two 
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable 
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle

[Verse 2]
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say "There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe 
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 3]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say "There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Does it kill  Does it burn  Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control 
Does it thrill  Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold 

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say "There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there  'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Ho-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Outro]
(Oh no) So this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me 
Why does every moment have to be so hard "
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Verse 2]
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made, kept me awake
Oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me 
Why does every moment have to be so hard "
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Outro]
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you[Intro: LunchMoney Lewis]
Hello, is this thing on  My man
See this one goes out to all the lovers
Lovers' lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days under covers
Girl, the sun could burn out, but you'll still shine
Aw, yeah

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
No, don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
'Cause I'm sure that the time will come

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
No don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the day is gone
And don't ask me if I stay true
When you know you're the only one

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay

[Verse 3: LunchMoney Lewis]
Ya
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you
Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes and I see the ocean
I ain't got no wings, but you got me floating on a cloud
Looking down, it's emotion
Champagne flutes, everybody toasting
Heart beat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down, spin you 'round and 'round
Can you hear me now 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, can you come here please  'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, could you come here please  'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Can we talk for a moment 
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, can you come here please  'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, could you come here please  'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wait, can we work this out 
I've been thinkin' out loud all day
Don't let me down
Can't live without my bae
And she wanna leave, but I think it's easier
If you let me be
You should come and see me, girl
Just think about it, girl
You should know I still think about you, yeah
I know you're into diamonds
I can tell you everything defined in you
But I'm like...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, can you come here please 
'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out 
Just wait, could you come here please 
'Cause I wanna be with you[Verse 1]
I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out

[Chorus]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
When did the rain become a storm 
When did the clouds begin to form 
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone

[Chorus]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

[Chorus]
Your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night 
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
It's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Woah, it's dripping from your eyes (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Hey, oh[Intro]
I just want the best for you

[Verse 1]
Yeah another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now
Yeah, I say I'm on my way now
Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Verse 2]
Parties with shots and powder
But you'd rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
'Til I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same as I was before I saw your face

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you

[Bridge]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you (for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
But I'm just not the best for you (I'm not the best for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby (Yeah)
Oh oh no, baby (Yeah)
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you[Verse 1]
Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

[Verse 2]
Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

[Bridge]
So sad, so sad

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad[Verse 1]
You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you wanna do this face to face
Bottle opens, we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here, you would stay

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Verse 2]
How did we end up in this situation 
Guess it went exactly as you planned
I always give in to your manipulation
I tried to resist, but I just can't

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Bridge]
Oh, as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
'Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again, yeah

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
Oh, yeah, oh

[Instrumental][Verse 1]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe 

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I m taking love
And it s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don t say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't think so

[Verse 2]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I m taking love
And it s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now so don t say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

[Bridge]
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing 
Oh, what was I thinking 
Is his heart still beating 

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro]
I don t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don t feel so bad (Don t you care about me anymore )
Don t you care about me  I don t feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore [Verse 1]
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Verse 2]
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasise
She'll make me want her right now right now
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Bridge]
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Outro]
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million[Verse 1]
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me; I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Verse 2]
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this 
We're in pieces, because you're over us, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me
So, un-kiss me
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
So, baby, let go, gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda run around
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me (Un-kiss me)
Un-touch me (Oh)
Un-take this heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm missing (I'm missing)
Just one thing
A brand new start (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
Un-kiss me[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oww!
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Verse 2]
All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, oh
No, I never told a lie
To you, so why would I start tonight 

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Bridge]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you[Intro]
Woo, woo!
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You and me and all that wine
Loosen my tie, lie down, let's fly
Every guy that passes by (Look at her, look at her, ooh)
And you say that it's not right
But where does he think you are tonight 
Does he know your nasty side  (Look at her, look at her, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want me, take me home and let me use you
I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you 
So let me tell you all the things he never told you, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
You and me, let's go all night
Going so high, we fuck the sky
Come with me now, fuck that guy (Look at her, look at her, ooh)
Now you flash that sexy smile
And tell me I've got to wait a while
And it makes me lose my mind (Look at her, look at her, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want me, take me home and let me use you
I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you 
So let me tell you all the things he never told you, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you (Can't fight these feelings)
No, I can't help myself no more
Ah-ah (Oh), ah-ah (Yeah), ah-ah (Can't help myself no more)
Ah-ah (Oh), ah-ah (Yeah), ah-ah (Oh)

[Bridge]
No, I can't wait much longer, it needs to happen now
'Cause I can't spend the rest of my life chasing you around
I want to get much closer, tou need to tell me how
Baby, how, how  Ooh, because I

[Chorus]
I've got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you (Can't fight these feelings for you)
No, I can't help myself no more
I've got these feelings for you
Got these feelings for you
Got these feelings for you
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more

[Outro]
Ah-ah (Yeah, yeah), ah-ah (Yeah), ah-ah
That's fine[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I know you're scared, ooh, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it, no
One more 'no' and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I see your face

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
Ooh, and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes[Verse 1]
It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2]
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, baby

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 3]
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then, the fact remains

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way[Verse 1]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now 
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you 

[Verse 2]
Is it real, is it fake 
Would you leave, would you stay 
Will the night turn into day 
Will we get closer  Or will it be over 
I'm only hoping I don't waste, I don't waste

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now 
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you 
If I bet my heart on you 

[Bridge]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now 
Would I lose, oh
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you 
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now 
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you 
If I bet my heart on you 
If I bet my heart on you [Verse 1]
You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up, so I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Verse 2]
Now someone else is taking you home, yeah
Hands on the waist, I used to hold
And I know it's my fault
I'm late to the dance
'Cause you couldn't wait for me and I understand
Why you never look back, once that door closed
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you still 
Do you, do you still 
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket 
Do you, do you still 
Do you, do you still 
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket 

[Bridge]
You're standing there with your cigarette (yeah)
Looking at me like we've never met

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket 
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Outro]
Do you, do you still 
Do you, do you still 
Do you wear that denim jacket [Intro: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I got them Now & Laters and them Jolly Ranchers, too
It ain't a question, but I got the answers, too
These shoes is Cavalli, and the pants is, too
When I see him, I'ma strip like the dancers do
I'ma show them how to do it like the pamphlets do
Show these girls how to do it off campus too
Yo, as long as you know he got the baddest, I'm flattered

And if you need it, then I'ma put it on ya
Ain't nothin' sweeter, you want this sugar, don't ya 
Up, down, inside, water park it, slip slide
Woulda, coulda, shoulda got ya sugar, get ya sugar

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me

Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it all right
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Oh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it all right
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than the Southern California Bay
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No make-up on, that's my sugar

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it all right
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me 
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it all right
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me [Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this d j -vu

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though
'Cause now I'm under your spell
Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this d j -vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

[Verse 2]
I keep saying that I'm okay
They never go so I pray
Dear Lord, I hope that one day
I, I get you out of my head
Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this d j -vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

[Bridge]
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go 
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go 

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this d j -vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh

[Outro]
I keep seeing visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you[Verse 1]
I watched you cry
Bathed in sunlight
By the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have, oh yeah
'Cause I can't believe that it's over

[Verse 2]
You've hit your low
You've lost control and you wanna come back
You may not believe me but I gave you all I had
Undress, confess that you're still mine
Roll around in a bed full of tears
I'm still lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
No, I can't believe that it's over now
It's just a feeling, just a feeling that I have

[Bridge]
So much to say
It's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
And in the darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save

[Chorus]
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

[Outro]
I can't believe that it's over
I can't believe that it's over
Now I can't believe that's it's over, yeah[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now 
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this 
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out 

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Post-Chorus]
So you say "Go, it isn't working"
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Bridge]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet 
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Post-Chorus]
So you say "Go, it isn't working"
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Outro]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have[Verse 1]
All I gave to you
Was my heart, my keys, my bed, my home
All I gave to you
Was my time, my green, my favorite jeans, and everything you choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you take all that, can you take all that 
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Oh can you take off that
And give one thing back
Woah, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, all you gave me was
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic
How'd you make it feel like love 
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic)
How'd you make it feel like love  (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose

[Verse 2]
All I asked to you
Was to prove to me that you were real
All I need from you
Was the pose, the breath, the sun, and life
Something I can feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that, can you fake all that 
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that 
'Cause when I look back
Woah, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, all you gave me was
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic
How'd you make it feel like love

How'd you make it feel like love  (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose

[Bridge]
Woah
You were something beautiful, I know
I wonder why our love could never grow
But you just couldn't hide it anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic)
How'd you make it feel like love 
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose (oh)
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic, yeah)
How'd you make it feel like love  (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose (oh)

[Outro]
Plastic rose (yeah)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose[Verse 1]
You left me hanging from the thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behavior
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something s gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright

[Bridge]
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can't be close
But I'll try my best to reach you

[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
Cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah[Verse 1]
I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go 
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you

[Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Break]
Oh, oh, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Verse 2]
When did we cross the line  How could we could forget
Why did we let the pressure get into our heads 
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

[Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Bridge]
Please don't loose your faith
Don't worry cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down, I won't let you down

[Break]
I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Chorus]
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 3]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah[Verse 1]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, "Oh oh oh," can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, "Oh oh oh," it isn't funny anymore

[Hook]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh
I was the man who never lied, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore

[Hook]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart

It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket

[Verse 2]
So, what you spying on me for, me for 
Tell me what you're looking for, yeah
This shit you said is so low, so low
No love, no love, no no
But tell me, where do you go, you go
When you say you need time alone, yeah
You really think I don't know, don't know

Show me that phone in your pocket[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

[Chorus: Rihanna with Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more

Winter with the raindrop
You can make the rain stop
You can make the pain stop
Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing
Issue that I miss you, wanna kiss you on your neck, aye
Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy
Feelings turn to a brickwall, there I was
Told me that you got a new love but I...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Is it better now that I'm not around

Are you happy now 
Are you happy now 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me  Of what we used to be  (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around  (That I'm not around)
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now 
Are you happy now 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
(Oh hey)

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
No more  please stop 
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this 
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this 
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Do you think that I should just go on without you 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh (The way I used to love you)
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Outro]
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start 

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...

[Verse 2]
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel[Verse 1]
You got in so late, it's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us
Where did we go wrong 
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight
Pack your things and go

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright

[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love
Never let it go, oh, yeah
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold ya
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
Oh, oh, baby, please don't go

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright

[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Now you say you're leaving California[Verse 1]
You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

[Verse 2]
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Verse 3]
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

[Verse 4]
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me  'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

[Verse 2]
Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun and then
You call me up at 3AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me  'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby, make it loud

[Interlude]
Yeah, come on

[Bridge]
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me  'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby, make it loud[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Verse 2]
This is not goodbye, she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Bridge]
There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through, oh

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Outro]
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out[Verse 1]
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was like disco superfly

[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair 
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction 
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had too much caffeine
And I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And then there she was wearin that platform double suede
Yeah, there she was like disco lemonade

[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair 
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction 
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah

[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair 
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction 
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah[Verse 1]
Baby, it's not alright
The second that you turn your back, she'll be outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart
How could you do it 
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made 
How could you do it 
Oh, you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane

[Chorus]
Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Verse 2]
Baby she'll eat you alive
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter
How could you do it 
Oh, just come back to me
Baby, I'm begging, please
How could you do it 
Oh, she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill

[Chorus]
Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller[Verse 1]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Talk to me, talk to me)

[Chorus]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight[Verse 1]
I'll be your sun and your moon tonight
I can be whatever you like, ooh
I was alone but I'm ready to feel
I wanna show you my feelings are real, yeah
All this time I've been living it up
And every night I'd be falling in love, ooh
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night, yeah

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now 
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me 
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me 

[Verse 2]
What the fuck  I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave to the way that you move
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do, yeah
I can tell that you're needing my love
And all I want is to give it to ya
And don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret it the rest of your life, yeah

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now 
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me 
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me 

[Bridge]
I still don't get it, 'cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah
'Cause I know I lie, and it wouldn't kill you trying
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
'Til you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now 
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me 
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me [Verse 1]
I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be ok to show my face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you ever turn your head and look 
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh

[Verse 2]
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You better turn your head and run
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Tangled

[Outro]
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 1]
It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu-fu-fucking snob that you'll never know the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to ge-ge-ge-ge-get you all

[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Yeah

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Outro]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do 

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break

[Verse 2]
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can t see it clearly
While you re standing there, it disappears
It disappears

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break

[Verse 3]
Saw you sitting all alone
You re fragile and you re cold, but that s all right
Life these days is getting rough
They ve knocked you down and beat you up
But it s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break, baby[Verse 1]
Looking at the same sky that we used to lay under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us 

[Pre-Chorus]
When you close your eyes, do you see me, love 
Am I keeping you awake 
What you scared about  Are you giving up 
When you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts
But I will come running for you; I don't care how far

[Pre-Chorus]
When you close your eyes, do you see me, love 
Am I keeping you awake 
What you scared about  Are you giving up 
When you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah

[Bridge]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry now, now
Don't you worry now

[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too

I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Till sundown when i come through
I need a girl like you yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call  Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden 
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more a white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you're far
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar (ah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you[Verse 1]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do 
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it

[Verse 2]
And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way we used to melt 
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you 
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

[Bridge]
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you 
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you 

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Chorus]
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

[Outro]
I ain't ever coming back to you[Verse 1]
Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home
You taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, oh baby ohhh
Give a little more, oh baby oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
Get a little more from you baby

[Verse 2]
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, oh baby ohhh
Give a little more, oh baby oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby ohhh
Get a little more from you baby

[Bridge]
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end (Gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend
I never want to feel this way again oh

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby oh
Get a little more from you baby

[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby oh
Get a little more from you baby[Intro]
Yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
I am so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my life with you
The same thing's, baby
Since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
Baby, baby
I'll never be untrue, baby
Ooh, baby
Let's, ought to stay together

[Chorus]
Loving you, whether, whether times are
Good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

[Break]
Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Whether times are good are bad
Happy or sad
Come on
Why, somebody, why people break up 
Oh
Turn around and make up
I just can't see
Cause you'd never do that to me, baby
Would you baby
Being around you is all I see
Ooh baby, let's, we ought to stay together

[Chorus]
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on

[Verse 3]
Let's babe, ought to stay together, baby
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on
Good or bad
Happy or sad
Come on
Good or bad
Happy or sad

[Outro]
Oh, oh[Verse 1]
When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again 
Think again my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Verse 2]
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Outro]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home[Intro: Gucci Mane]

It's Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane & Adam Levine]
Baby, why you turn so cold on me  (Brr)
All the things that you said took a toll on me
Told me you would take the charge but you told on me
I thought that you rock with me but you rolled on me
How my best friend turn into my enemy 
I really love you, girl, but I don't need the energy
You broke my heart, girl and I can't find the remedy
Now me and you can't even be in the same vicinity
Your friends interferin', they should throw a penalty
And you can't see it but them bitches full of jealousy
You played yourself, you had the baller of the century
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out 
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold[Verse 1]
I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

[Verse 2]
I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means
And your American dream, baby, it just isn't me
I know what I'm thinking may not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

[Bridge]
This feeling keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drive me in questions 

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
There's something about my ego, tell her back up, Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes, I just sex em, bend the ass like Beckham
Undress em, respect em, just for the night, then after that I forget them
Neglected, I'm sorry girl, turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
No time for tears, if you cryin' call Maury
Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
Love it when I m on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap, but I spend big
Cause I

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away, make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a sh*t
And it goes like this

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger

[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key
So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger[Verse 1]
I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

[Chorus]
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how 
But how 

[Verse 2]
I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now
And don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man, be a woman now, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up, (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

[Chorus]
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how 
But how 
But how 
But how 

[Verse 3]
Oh, yeah
Why must we be so ugly 
And please do not think ill of me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to cry
Why 
Why 
Why 
(And how  How )

[Outro]
But I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying[Intro]
I really, I really, whoa
I really need to know
I really, I really, whoa
Or else, you got to let me go, oh
I really, I really

[Verse 1]
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder

[Pre-Chorus]
I really, I really need to know
Or else you got to let me go, oh

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter

[Verse 2]
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming and I cannot
Shut up, oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot get up

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh and I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you got to let me go, oh

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter

[Bridge]
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Got to stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinking under

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
Cause it feels so good you make me stutter
You make me stutter
You make me stutter[Intro]
Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
(Put your hands all over me)

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay and she got up and ran away
Well now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
(Put your hands all over me)

[Verse 2]
Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, it's gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
All over me

[Bridge]
So come down off your cloud
Say it now say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl come make my day

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Got to talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Got to walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Love is a game you say play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Yeah (all over me)

[Outro]
Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me[Verse 1]
Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
But I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

[Chorus]
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

[Chorus]
But I have, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Bridge]
'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact, you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
Deep down you know, yeah

[Chorus]
I have, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Chorus]
Already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
I m drowned in someone else s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Outro]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
You dry[Verse 1]
I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day

[Pre-Chorus]
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

[Verse 2]
I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else

[Pre-Chorus]
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

[Bridge]
My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday[Verse 1]
Yeah, you gotta let it go 'cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you 
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you, you

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot

[Verse 2]
You never let me go
Got me chained to your touch, like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true, oh
Afraid to let you go, cause without you, I'm lost
And not matter the cost, I'll be standing next to you, oh

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot

[Bridge]
My back's against the wall tonight
So go ahead pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
I see the fear that's in your eyes
So go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot[Verse 1]
You re such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared
But it s so strange, it s something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I m alone
Wonder what it d be like to make you moan

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
Than anything you ve ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world, it disappears so fast

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don t stop it before it begins

[Verse 2]
So give it up, and don t pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won t regret
The things I whisper in your ear
"What " I said:

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
(You wann give me something better)
Than anything you ve ever had
(Than anything I ve ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don t stop it before it begins

[Verse 3]
I can t wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails
Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere
Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait 
Don t think that I can wait

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don t stop it before it begins (hey, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi (want to give you something better than this)
Your juices dripping down my chin (hey, yeah)
So please, let me (want to give you something better than this)
Don t stop it before it begins

[Outro]
Don t stop it before it begins
Don t stop it before it begins
Don t stop it before it begins
Don t stop it before it begins[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
All alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do 
And I can't stop thinking about your love

[Break]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do 
And I can't stop, and I can't stop

[Bridge]
What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
Let me show you

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do 
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do 
And I can't stop thinking about you[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this time 
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified
What am I supposed to do to get by 
Did I lose everything I need to survive 
'Cause at 4 AM when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message  Did it send 
Or did you just get on with your life 
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and
I don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do with these clothes 
It's my twisted way of keeping you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message  Did it send 
Or do you get along on your own 

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and
I don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Verse 3]
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end 

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and
I don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
Oh, I'm taking time to think and
I don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Outro]
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway[Verse 1]
From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me 
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Verse 2]
Three more days 'til I see your face
I m afraid it s far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You re my reason for living
And there s no way I m giving up, oh

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me 
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Verse 3]
Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I m eating home alone on a Friday night
I know what your friends say
"He's just wasting your love and time"
I will never let you change your mind

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me 
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Chorus (Variation)]
No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me 
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Outro]
Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don t cry, you don t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there 

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again
I m not falling apart

[Break]
Ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you d stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways
Mm
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again
I m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What s the problem  I can t see
You destroyed me, I won t fall apart again
I m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change 

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again
I m not falling apart

[Bridge]
I heard you say you needed me now
What s the problem  I can t see
You destroyed me, I won t fall apart again
I m not falling apart

[Outro]
Oh, ooh[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm sipping champagne 'til we throw it up
I drinked enough for both of us
You talking way, way too fast for me now
So pour up everything to slow it all up
I talked about this "finally famous" lifestyle way back, baby when we was growing up
Made a few plays now everything that we talked about showing up, and I could chauffeur up
But I still get lost on the map to your heart
So far gone let's take it back to the start
To the part where we carved our name in the bark
Preserved all the feelings like it came in the jar
I guess life ain't no picnic basket
Put four years in and came out a bachelor
This time around how does me and you sound
Cause honestly to me it sounds mixed and mastered
Right 

[Verse 2: Maroon 5]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away 

[Pre-Hook: Maroon 5]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook: Maroon 5]
But I wonder, where were you 
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you 
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 3: Maroon 5]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Hook: Maroon 5]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook: Maroon 5]
But I wonder, where were you 
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you 
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following[Verse 1]
I m sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don t trust me
Why must we do this to one another 
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it s over

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 

[Verse 2]
Well, I ve got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
 Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 

[Bridge]
Oh my, I don t mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it [Verse 1]
You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm going to show you what it's all about

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Aren t no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you want to impress me (Yeah)
You can't be too flirty, mama
And I know how to undress me (Yeah)
I want to be your fantasy
And maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Aren t no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

[Verse 3]
Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
See act your age not your shoe size
(Not your shoe size)
And I could show you how to do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
Just leave it all up to me
My love will be your fool
Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Aren t no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss[Verse 1: Adam Levine]

[Bridge: Adam Levine & SZA]
Aren't we too grown for games 
Aren't we too grown to play around 
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin' 
Are we too grown to mess around 
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh, ooh)[Verse 1]
Baby, I don t want to spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn t pass right by you
Maybe it s because you are so insecure
Maybe you plain don t care
Maybe it s the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it s just not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I m touching your skin
If it s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me 
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

[Verse 2]
Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
Now I'm facing something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

[Pre-Chorus]
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I m touching your skin
If it s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me 
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

[Bridge]
I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeah

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I m touching your skin
If it s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me 
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
Tell me "action", speak louder
But there's something about her words
That hurt
Closing up, it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door
On our way home, I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

[Chours: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes
Out of goodbyes

[Verse 2: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same
About me
I wonder, does your man still shudder
When you touch his hand 
Like this man

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lady Antebellum]
Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes (we're out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes (we're out of goodbyes)[Verse 1]
People never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games
Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searching for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, Oh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothing s all I got, Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

[Bridge]
Oh
Somebody make it stop
Yeah
And pick me up
And just dust me off, Oh
The rainy day flood
Will drowned all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry[Verse 1]
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
To the ones that are waiting only for you
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
Away from the life that you always knew
We are calling to you

[Verse 2]
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
In the shade of the night we ll come looking for you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
To the ones appointed to see it through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

[Verse 3]
Come away little lamb
Come away to the water
Give yourself so we might live anew
Come away little lamb
Come away to the slaughter
To the ones appointed to see this through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

[Verse 4]
Come away little lamb
Come away to the water
To the arms that are waiting only for you
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter
To the one appointed to see this through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you[Verse 1]
I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

[Chorus]
Oh, what you going to do 
I'm in love with you
Don't you want to dance 
This may be the last chance (last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (to love you)
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause you re the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more

[Chorus]
Oh, what you going to do 
I'm in love with you
Don't you want to dance 
This may be the last chance (last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (to love you)
Oh oh oh
Oh, what am I going to do 
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call yourself impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

[Chorus]
Oh, what you going to do 
I'm in love with you
Why don't you want to dance 
Cause this may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)

[Chorus]
Oh, what am I going to do 
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance
That you get to love me
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Cause this may be the last chance that I get to love you
Oh, oh, oh
To love you
Oh oh oh[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

[Break]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone
Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think 
I was just going to roll over  Oh no

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
Oh, I don't want to be alone

[Break]
Ooh
Ooh
I don't wanna be

[Verse 3]
I've put myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me, no oh

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

[Bridge]
Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh[Verse 1]
Stuck inside my head
Like a song you can't forget
So don't be so uptight
We can leave that all behind, yeah

You and me tonight
What I do  Yeah, feel so crazy, right 
What I do  Let me play with you tonight

All night, all night, all night
(One, two, three, four)[Verse 1]
You are relentless
I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight 
You beat me senseless
I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try 

[Pre-Chorus]
Your whisper, so clear
The world disappeared
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You reprimand me
You're so demanding
But I've got time
I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect
Completely worth it
You've got my back against the wall
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Your whisper, so clear
The world disappeared
As I fall into the darkness
Impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

[Bridge]
And can you hear me calling 
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me 'cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Right on back to you, right on back to you

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

[Outro]
Get back in my life
Ooh, come on now
Yeah
Oh
I'll never leave you alone[Verse 1]
How ya feelin' 
The day has had its way with both of us
And oh, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday
You would come around
But no, no, no
I'm not thinking that way

[Interlude]
'Cause now I see
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in

[Verse 2]
How's your day been  (yeah)
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no, no, no
I feel better today
Because I'm off my knees

[Interlude]
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
Lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore  (yeah)

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
Lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore (oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woahh
Ohh, woah, woahh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
Oh, my pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Outro: Adam Levine]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
Oh yeah, yeah...
And she will be loved...[Verse 1]
This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you
Going south, kiss your mouth, lick my lips
Grab your hips, can t remember why I fell in love with this

[Chorus]
But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time cause oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won t be getting my affection again
Cause I don't need you

[Verse 2]
Who do you think you are 
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, your love's not real
Cause the love that I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel

[Chorus]
But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time cause oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won t be getting my affection again cause oh no
I don't need you tonight

[Verse 3]
It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay, get out my way it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

[Chorus]
I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time cause oh no
You beg me you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
Cause oh no, I don't need you
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time cause oh no
You beg me, you ask me to
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
Cause oh no, I don't need you tonight[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh, uh-huh
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh, uh-huh
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)

[Post-Chorus]
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular, oh

[Bridge]
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh (woo-hoo), uh-huh (woo-hoo)

[Outro]
This summer's gonna hurt like a mother, uh-huh[Verse 1]
It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older
Why would you  How could I 
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I 

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, You eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry  cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Bridge]
I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind[Verse 1]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (All those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus - Maroon 5]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, Yeah

[Verse 2 - Maroon 5]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus - Maroon 5]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro - Maroon 5]
If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby[Verse 1]
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

[Chorus]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world 
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
Oh

[Chorus]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world 
There's nothing to it

[Outro]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be[Verse 1]
You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only tryin' to help

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever forever forever

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Verse 2]
I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever forever forever

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Bridge]
Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you re in too deep

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it allI remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
Something so special about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, so much space
And when you're out there
Out there, I'm out of touch, babe
It wasn't because I didn't know enough, no
I knew too much
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
I heard that you had
Had the time of your life
Don't think twice, don't think twice
That's my advice to you
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you think you are 
Ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control
Yeah, I think you're crazy
Yes, I think you're crazy
Oh, I think you're crazy
Oh, I think you're crazy, baby
My heroes had the heart
To live a li li li to live
And all I remember is that
I want to be like them
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy, childSome day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Yes you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it 
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Yes you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it 
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight
Darling
Just the way you look tonight[Verse 1]
Do you mean all the things you are 
Are you pleased with the way things are 
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen

[Verse 2]
Do you give just to please yourself 
Do you wish you were somewhere else 
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me

[Chorus]
And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you 
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

[Verse 3]
Have you learned all the secrets yet 
Will you burn by the things I've said 
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine

[Chorus]
And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you 
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

[Verse 4]
I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one

[Verse 5]
Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

[Verse 6]
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes True
Come true
True
It comes true
True[Verse 1]
This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse 
You're so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face 
Don't want to spend the night and wake up
Realize I've made a big mistake

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast
I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

[Verse 2]
I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
Your super stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

[Bridge]
No more kisses on your lips, the tender touch is peace
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be
And I just can t get over you, and until you're over me

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you
It hurts so much to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
Are we taking time or a time out 
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus]
Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so...

[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for 
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for 
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use 
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus]
Distant (oh) when we're kissing (yeah)
Feel so different (yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so...

That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think of me  Of what we used to be 
Is it better now that I'm not around 
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

Uh oh, uh oh[Verse 1]
Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding  (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 2]
I tried and tried and tried and tried
But I have no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 3]
I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around

[Verse 4]
And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I wasSo this is Christmas
And what have you done 
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
Near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

And so happy Christmas
For black and for white
Yellow and red ones

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas

And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over
If you want it
War is over
Now[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
With the burning of love hanging over my head
As I walked into the living room
Sit with you
Discuss what's going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it me 
Is it you 
Is it something I forgot to do 
Oh, tell me so that I understand

[Chorus]
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning with a hurting
That I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she 
What the hell do you people want 

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it me 
Is it you 
Is it something I forgot to do 
Oh, tell me so that I understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me anyway

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Hey, hey
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah'
Oh

[Chorus]
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me[Verse 1]
I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed
Her need; cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away 

[Chorus]
We could spend some time together
What he had, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So let s figure it out, let's go

[Verse 2]
I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that your passionate
I m happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last
I know you want to break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it s gotta be

[Chorus]
We could spend some time together
What he had, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So let s figure it out, let's go

[Verse 3]
I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy you re going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

[Chorus]
We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out, let's go
We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's...go[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right 
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night 

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 1]
Leaving the clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman[Intro]

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
This thing (this thing)
Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

{Break}

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get, get on my tracks
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike (ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah

Crazy little thing called love, yeah
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, oh
Crazy little thing called...love, oh
Woo[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You try to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe[Chorus: Adam Levine & Cardi B]

Help me, got no soul to sell
Help me, the only thing that works for me
Help me, get away from myself

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside

And I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You bring me closer to God

You can't help my isolation, you can't help the hate it brings

You can't help my absent of faith
You can't help my everything

Help me, turn on my reason
Help me, s** I can smell
Help me, you make me perfect shape
Help me, think I'm somebody else

I wanna fuck you like an animal

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost

Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (Ooh, yeah)
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call  Bardi, Cardi

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post Chorus: Background]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam
Why do you do what you do to me  Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me  Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me  Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me  Yeah

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Forever young
I wanna be forever youngWhen I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
...lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day...

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

[Verse 1]
I get so hungry
But what I got is not enough
Don't got any money
No fancy car and no sexy scars
But I, I do have something
That you want
And I'll love you till I crumble to the ground

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
I won't say goodbye anymore

[Chorus 2]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
(That may) That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline (Yeah, yeah)
Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, whoa)
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need (all I need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave (Yeah)

Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need (all I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)

It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Ooh, yeah, yeah...[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved[Verse 1]

I won't let anyone hurt you
And I'll stop them if they try to
Nobody knows you like I do, baby
And I don't care where you run to
Because I'm gonna find you
When the stars all align
We can try again

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there  (whoa)
Can anybody see  (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So where did all your love go
You play me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away, yeah
I know that we can make it
And I know that you can feel me
So stop fooling around and just stay

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there  (whoa)

[Verse 3: PJ Morton]
It's taken such a long time
To find what I've been looking for
And now that you are all mine
I never felt quite like this before
Still want more
All you need in my mind
Because if so, then you already know
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there  (whoa)
Can anybody see  (whoa)

Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me 
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lies, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
I am one of a kind like a white lion
Drop down fangs in the night time
We can do things until the sun rises
She got that sunshine, I'm talkin' 'bout good good
And when she expose her super moon
I'ma give her that good wood
Astronaut, plant a pole with a flag on it
Best she ever had and clearly all she ever wanted, homie
#YouCouldNeverBeThis
Another #StevieWonderYouWillNeverSeeThisEither
I run my fingers over that cleavage like I'm reading braille
She's the leading lady in every one of my freaky tales
Loyale and royale, she earned her crown and throne
Ride or die to the fullest, a house is not a home when she's gone

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...[Verse 1: Adam Levine]

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

[Tag: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call  Bardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden 
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more of white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar (ah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

I need a girl like you[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this 
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out 

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Bridge]
So you say "Go, it isn't working"
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Verse 3]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet 
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Bridge]
So you say "Go, it isn't working"
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Outro]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I haveLiving easy, lovin' free
Season ticket, on a one - way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

No stop signs, speedin' limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan! Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Dont stop me!

I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!

And I'm goin down..all the way!
I'm on the highway to hell..[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right 
And if I ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night 

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 2]
Leaving your clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start 

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 

[Verse 2]
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
Yeah, oh, oh
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out 
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for 
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for 
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use 
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna' stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You got a gold bar where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I m taking love
And it s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't think so

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]
If you needed love (Needed love), well, then ask for love (Ask for love)
Could have given love (Given love), now I m taking love (Taking love)
And it s not my fault (Not my fault) 'cause you both deserve (Both deserve)
What's coming now (Coming now) so don t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

[Bridge: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]
I'm so sorry, darling (Ooh-ooh)
Did I do the wrong thing  (Do the wrong thing)
Oh, what was I thinking 
Is his heart still beating 

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige, (Mary J. Blige)]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore  (Don't you care)
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall (Six foot tall)
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
(Shoot him dead)
He won't come around here anymore (Come around here)
Come around here  I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore  (Don't you care )
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
(Don't you care, don't you care )
Don t you care about me  I don't think so[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Stretch my hands and feet to the corner of your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Verse 2]
This is not goodbye, she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woahSometimes I'm right, but I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Ooh sha sha, we got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one that will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Ooh sha sha, oh yeah, we got to live together

There is a yellow one
That won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one

Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

'Cause I am everyday people
'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause I am everyday people
'Cause I am everyday people[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now 
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there 
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there 
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 3]
I hang your picture well
I frame it, maybe need a nail
Or some tape, to stick it on the wall
When I walk in, it stay
Or maybe Velcro
To strap your bows and patches on the elbows
In the coat when it's cold
I mean winter-cold
That's rain, sleet, hail, snow
Hell, no
She's lookin' at me like I sell bras
But, I don't, wouldn't, won't
I am not that guy
Cross my T's, dot that I
Say it's hard to breathe 
We are not that high
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Breathe it in, out again
Oxygen, count me out
Ten products in the aisle that I cannot
Breathe in, shoots in and think
If they sink, I won't swim
Like I won't hold my breath when I float in this bitch
Backstroke, high-dive, diving boards don't slip
And belly-flop, knock the block outta your socks
And your feet in the water, there to shock ya
Make it harder to breathe

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there 
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe[Verse 1]
They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 2]
They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Bridge]
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released[Verse]
Spent 24 hours
I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend
Getting even, ooh ooh
We spent the late nights
Making things right, between us
But now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

[Drop]
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

[Verse 2]
I spent last night
On the last flight to you
Took a whole day up
Trying to get way up, ooh ooh
We spent the daylight
Trying to make things right between us
And now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you


[Drop]
Oh I need a girl like you, yeah
I need a girl, need a girl
Oh you know that I need you[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back...
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back you, memories bring back
Memories bring back you, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back you, memories bring back
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back youIf I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you

If I fell in love with you[Verse 1]
When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again 
Think again my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 

[Verse 2]
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Bridge]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone 
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown 
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Outro]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home[Intro: Female Vocial]

David Banner, nigga

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe 

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I m taking love
And it s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't think so

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I m taking love
And it s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now so don t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3: David Banner]
I couldn't disrespect the crib, you brought a man where I live
Now my pistol pointed tryin' to leave led in his ribs
What's in something that I did, what's it time I did the spin
When I think about him, I think time you crack a rib
Call a preacher at the corner it all when wrong
David Banner, Maroon 5
This is bigger then the song, dawg
Yeah! Uh!

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here  I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I don t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don t feel so bad (Don t you care about me anymore )
Don t you care about me  I don t feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore 
Don t you care about me  I don't think so[Verse 1]
I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be ok to show my face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you ever turn your head and look 
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Verse 2]
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up[Verse 1]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do 
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it

[Verse 2]
And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way we used to melt 
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you 
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

[Bridge]
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you 
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you 

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Chorus]
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 3]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything is reminding me of you
What can I do 

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break

[Verse 2]
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You re scared and that you think that I m insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can t see it clearly
While you re standing there, it disappears
It disappears

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break

[Verse 3]
Saw you sitting all alone
You re fragile and you re cold, but that s all right
Life these days is getting rough
They ve knocked you down and beat you up
But it s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

[Chorus]
It s not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we re better off this way 
I m not fine, I m in pain
It s harder everyday
Maybe we re better off this way 
It s better that we break, baby[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call  Bardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden 
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more of white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar (ah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too

Yeah, oh oh, yeah
Several miles from the sunPeople never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games

Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searchin for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, Ohhh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothin's all I got, Ohhh

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her

The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Ohh
Somebody make it stop
Yeahh
And pick me up
And just dust me off, Ohh
The rainy day flood
Will drowned all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason (reason)
And you don't have the time (time)
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I 
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I 
So this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I

[Chorus]
So this is goodbye
Is this the end of you and I 
So this is goodbye
Lying to my lovers eyes
So this is goodbye

[Bridge]
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore (Ho-oh-oh-oh)
You caught me in a lie (Ho-oh)
I have no alibi (Ho-oh)
The words you say don't have a meaning  (Ho-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

[Chorus]
Is this the end of you and I 
So this is goodbye
Lying to my lovers eyes
So this is goodbye

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Post-Chorus]
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular, oh

[Bridge]
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Outro]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker[Verse 1]
You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

[Verse 2]
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Verse 3]
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

[Verse 4]
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin[Intro]
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I haven't seen a smile from you in 12 weeks
You just wanna be my friend, not married to me
But why you gotta be so mean, why you gotta be so mean
I refuse to welcome you if you're gonna be like this

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Be nice, do it nice, or do it twice
You ain't 'bout to go wonderin' round my house bein' mean to my other friends who were invited to this party
Nights like this are ruined by you
You can't stop just this once 

[Verse 2: Melanie Martinez]
The reason I'm b-b-being like this
Is to just butt into this party
I am a party ruiner
Don't expect me to b  nice
You're going to get push d and shoved

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Be nice, do it nice, or do it twice
You ain't 'bout to go wonderin' round my house bein' mean to my other friends who were invited to this party
Nights like this are ruined by you
You can't stop just this once 

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Not gonna call you until
Not gonna call you until
Not gonna call you until
You can be nice

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Be nice, do it nice, or do it twice
You ain't 'bout to go wonderin' round my house bein' mean to my other friends who were invited to this party
Nights like this are ruined by you
You can't stop just this once [Drop]

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now 
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

I know I don't know you...
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't
(That was dope)[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don t cry, you don t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there 

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again
I m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What s the problem I can t see
You destroyed me, I won t fall apart again
I m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don t cry, you don t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there 

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What s the problem I can t see
You destroyed me, I won t fall apart again
I m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change 

[Chorus]
Now I can t walk, I can t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I m stuck living out that night again
I m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What s the problem  I can t see
You destroyed me, I won t fall apart again
I m not falling apart, oohI don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello!

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me

So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello![Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
(And she will be loved)
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
(And she will be loved)
And her heart is breaking in front of meOh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be
I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting near, I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me 
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back...(fade)[Disorted Voice]

[Verse 1]
I m sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don t trust me
Why must we do this to one another 
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it s over

[Distorted Voice]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said

[Distorted Voice]

[Verse 2]
Well, I ve got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
 Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

[Distorted Voice]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said

[Distorted Voice]

[Bridge]
Oh my, I don t mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Chorus]
Please don t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it 

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said, said, said...

[Distorted Voice]Where you are seems to be as far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start 

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back, I have something to say

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I

Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back, I have something to say

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home 
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel...I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same

Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back[Cross]
Shorty, when I meet ya, daddy gotta freak ya
You can be my teacher, hit me on my beeper
Hey, you got your freakum dress on
Spaghetti strap stilleto
Coup look yellow
Oh, no, Kid Cross gon' blow
The girls say I'm too fly, no, I'm not a good guy
Party with Maroon 5, sour got me red-eye
Oh, I'm a rockstar, baby

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway (Sway)
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one (Oh)
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before (Oh)
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
This is the remix
Everybody to the dance floor right now
Showtime!

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Talk to me)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
In the visuals, Maroon 5, swizzy beats

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Bounce hands up, hands up hands up hands up hands up
H-h-hands up[Verse 1]
You left me hanging from the thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

[Verse 2]
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can't be close
But I'll try my best to reach you

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh[Intro]
This, this...
She said goodbye
This, this...

[Chorus]
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
She said goodbye too many times before

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things (Taken its toll)
Repair your broken wings
I'll fix these broken things (Taken its toll)
Repair your broken wings
Taken its toll...

[Chorus]
This love
This love has taken its toll
This love
This love has taken its toll
Taken its toll...[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Outro fading out]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right 
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night 

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 1]
Leaving the clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door (Walking)
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin

'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Get tonight

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time

[Chorus: Rihanna with Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, (Rihanna), Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me  Of what we used to be  (What we used to be)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more  please stop 
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this 
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this 
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]

[Outro]
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh ohMaking love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding 
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy hungry for your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I've no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer, life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh, dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding 
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
And I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love, it was yours to take
Break down your door, take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving, it's a new low
Try and pick me up again but let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was[Bridge]
Open dreams and open feelings, oh
They deny our path through
Feelings and miseries, oh
No one gets the lookup
Oh, I tried and I tied, no
Oh no, it did not work
Well I tried[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need...
I just need a little of your time
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said, said, said...[Verse 1]
You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

[Verse 2]
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Verse 3]
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

[Verse 4]
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skinBaby, I want the Christmas spirit

Yea Yea Yeaah!I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore...[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break, yeah
Hot air balloon that could go to space, yeah
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

(Because I'm happy) Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeahSunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow
It's flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me  (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (Hey)
You're like a drug that's killing me (Hey)
I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough (Hey)
You're still in my head, forever stuck (Hey)
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah (Hey)
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up (Hey)
But don't deny the animal (Hey)
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out 
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to f- with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold


[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for 
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for 
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use 
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
I don't understand why you're so cold


[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so coldCold enough to-
Chill my bones
It feels like I don't-
Know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so-

Look
I don't mean to be the bad guy but-
Some would say that the shoes fit
And I been chewing on hearts like beef jerkey
So I got a lil stuck and I think I need a tooth pick
Fall fast and hard
Like I'm an Aston Martin
Off a cliff at dark
But I'm in at a bargain
Cause you ain't ever met another like me-
Young V, CD, make you go retarded-
I'm lyrically proficient when I'm driving the rhythm
But I won't let you up inside, you might need an incision
To see the corners of my mind that I often exist in
You want the pieces of my pie  Gotta make a decision
'Cause I been fizzing off the top, like a soda been shook
And I been pennin' down my thoughts, till I'm out of the books
Used to talk about the thots, ain't give 'em a look now
Listen to my hook now-

Cold enough to-
Chill my bones
It feels like I don't-
Know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so-[Verse 1]
I'm the one you're gonna take
From the following poisons
And I can't poison you, 'cause if I did
I'd get sued

Can you tell me who I am 
I've been wondering, so can you 
I have to get the airs on me
So why'd you even glare 

[Chorus]
Hands up, hands up
Hands down, hands down
Sands flying around
The airship requires towns

So, I'm coming
Down the path
Hands up, hands down
Everyone's getting the sound

[Verse 2]
Would be glad to tell you this
I'm in for seeing miss
Persia infamous
Teaming against the tip

I'm so annoyed now
'Cause you are all around
And editing skills, they say
Down, downtown

[Chorus]
Hands up, hands up
Hands down, hands down
Sands flying around
The airship requires towns

So I'm coming
Down the path
Hands up, hands down
Everyone's getting the sound

[Outro]
And as I feel the feelings you collected
I'm caught up with my name
It says to me: "Oh, day, oh, day"
As we try again and fade away
