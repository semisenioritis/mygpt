I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)

And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, " No m s!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars " (21)

Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at " (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore

You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose 
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do 
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do 
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take )
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now 
Can we have a little conversation 
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation 
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it 
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do 
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck

Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Hit the switch up the suicide doors (Damn)
We already know you vanished though (Ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me (Yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (Nah)

Take a second if you think about crossin' me

Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV  I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)

Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus

Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral  I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see 
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home[Intro]
I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides 

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me 
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Outro: Post Malone]
Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah
(Take what you want) Why don't you (Take what you need)
(What you need, yeah)[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool 
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change (Is gonna change), yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

So you know that I'm never ever coming back (Never coming back)
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag (In a Prada bag)

Beggin' on my knees on to the floor (To the floor)
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore

But you lied, you lied to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)

Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)

When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)[Verse 1]
Hunnid thousand for the chain and now my drop (Drop, drop)
When I pull out the garage, I chop my top (Top, top)
Just like a fiend, when I start I cannot stop (Whoa)

He love that I say what I feel, he feel what I say 'cause it's real

Ride, ho, ride, ho, alright (Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel)[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do 
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side  Will you save us 
Or will you run away 

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do  (What am I to do )
You re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand

She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again

[Verse 2]
Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go  A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

[Chorus]
Blame it on me (Ayy)

While I'm takin  a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up 
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been  (Where you been )
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel

Oh, girl, you a model  Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been "
Whoa

Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that "
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie 
What the heck 

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him 
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him 
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him 
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him 

[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff &  Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Don't you know my friend would do anything 
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him 
Why don't you love me 
Why don't you love him

Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, "Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix"
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi

Rap game got me pissed off, I'm coming to take it, there's no competition
I'm like that little sign that say I to commission
For those who don't listen, I demand detention
My new name should be shitload of issues
When we at the venue, they don't have a shot, they like unloaded pistols
And I'm countin' my money, I'm big in there honey
They call me billi' for short
Baby, my crib like we own a resort
But yo, that ain't important, what is anymore 
I got bars on bars on bars on bars on bars
And a bad bitch at my car
And she smart, and her frame, please don't get me started
Look, she don't wanna do normal shit
Tryna call me 'bout my government
And she only know the mogul for a couple minutes
But we out in public like we a couple wit' it
You ain't squad, then we ain't fuckin' wit' it
Plus, I really skate so there is a difference
If you ask me, they failed the mission
But you can come to the crib, see how we livin'

And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

And now, I can't get you out my head
You're just like a drug, just like a drug

Never had it easy, no, they always made it hard for me
Never gave me shit, had to get my own grip
I ain't perfect, I admit
I kept going, never quit
I provided for my fam, I made sure my dog's ate
Told my shawty 'Bae, I love you, I fuck with you the long way'

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends, I'm countin' bands in this new Chanel
Who gon' stick around to the end  Only time will tell
Tried to shoot me down, dig a hole for my funeral
'Said I fall off, little bitch, you delusional

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros  on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros  on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
Can't apologize, nah, bitch, it ain't no excuse
Where were you when I was down bad, wouldn't give me nothing
People only seem to come around when they need something
You left me in the storm by myself, I was all alone
Diamond cross necklace, hope it only ain't good to my soul
Homies got the judge and got me feeling like 2Pac
I heard that's what you gotta go do when you're this sad

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends, countin' bands in these YSL's
Throw a couple racks at little shawty 'cause she bad as hell
Diamond audemar on my wrist, it's a two tone
Wait a minute, hold up, who is this  This a new phone

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros  on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros  on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth[Verse 1]
Las Vegas, sorcerers and sages

Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!Lyrics from snippet

In the morning you gon' have to leave
All alone in my messy sheets
Ain't no breakfastLyrics from snippet

And I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Verse]
Wake up [ ]
I don't got no time, I got a lotta shit on my mind[Verse 1]
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not na ve
I've seen it all, I was here first

[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Verse 2]
In her false witness hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

Truth covered insecurity
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

[Chorus]
I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield

And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they still
Smell her on you
They still smell her on you
Smell her on you[Verse 1]
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head

Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

[Chorus]
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom
