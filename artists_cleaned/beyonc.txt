[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it 
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you 
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen "
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen "
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc  & JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now  Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USS  is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe

And tell me how it's looking babe

Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor

He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Driver, roll up the partition fast (Hey)
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby, be sweating out my hair
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Took a trip to clear my mind, oh

And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it  Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

'Cause they don t wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this  Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy  Jealous or crazy 
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride  No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy  Jealous and crazy 
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!

[Bridge 1: Beyonc ]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless

And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

[Bridge]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

[Outro]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing, my love [Verse 1]
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Outro]
How I missed you, my love[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built 
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo, oh oh

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same  (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com Com Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

[Verse 2]
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby

Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please

All up in your face 
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 2]
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby 
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 3]
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me 
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me 
Like on my worst day  Or am I not thirsty, enough 
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong 
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong 
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me 
Like on my worst day  Or am I not thirsty, enough 
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I found the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

[Verse 2]
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'

I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own[Intro: Harvey Keitel & Beyonc ]
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life 
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation

It's the soul that needs a surgery

Without falling down, down, down

It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake fa ade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you

My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come 
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Bridge]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous[Produced by BOOTS & Beyonc  Knowles]

I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though

Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy

Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (Hehe)

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Like a shark

Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

[Chorus: Beyonc  & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge: Beyonc  & (Frank Ocean)]

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us

Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Verse 2]
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

Tell me, do you wanna ride 
Tell me, do you wanna ride 
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town 
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

[Verse 1]
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane 
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care 
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had

What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply to the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Bridge]
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Verse 3]
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment

[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you 
I know you're probably thinking, "What's up with B "
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me 
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie [Intro]

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I m the one you want
If you don t, you ll be alone
And like a ghost, I ll be gone

Fuck with me, baby, I ll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot
And nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
Talking to me  Girl, why you fucking with me 
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-

Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

[Chorus: Andr  3000]

I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

It's not enough
I love blowing, you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words

I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you re already reading my mind
And I don t have a reason to be, if I can t be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can t sing your song
No, I don t need hands if I don t get to keep you warm
And I don t really need myself, if I don't need you

[Chorus]
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3]
So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4]
Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Verse 2]
You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

There for the grace of God go, I

You are my hunger, my thirst

You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh 
Some women were made...
But me, myself 
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you 
You feel me 

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why 
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes 
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me

[Verse 2]
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before, I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you

I'll never leave just, just keep loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Breakdown]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
And tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe

Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower

High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor

Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor

Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor[Verse 1]
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Verse 2]
I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be

And it was more than I thought it would be

Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here

I was here[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that 
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl[Intro: Beyonc ]
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you  bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret  no

[Refrain: Beyonc ]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up  don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh  take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'  I'm takin' my own advice

[Verse: Beyonc ]
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh
You're part of something way bigger

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

[Chorus: Beyonc  & RAYE]
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah

You're part of something way bigger

Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide 

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this 

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere

'Cause you're mine

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)

I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Baby, while I'm on my grind
And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own

Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones

If I let you go

I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you 
Why would you risk it, baby 
Is that the price I that pay 
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things 
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)

If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go

Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Beyonc )]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming 
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Baby girl you should already know

'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference 
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever  That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No D j  Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having D j  Vu

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu

I got a big ego (Ha ha ha), I m such a big ego (Uh-uh-uh)
I got a big, (eh-eh-eh), ego, she love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don t understand why they trippin , if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg  Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you re here with me
That s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why  Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 3: Beyonc ]
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Outro: Beyonc ]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talking deep
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh

I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh

So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking of your kiss
And your warm embrace yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh

[Chorus]
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from meI tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating 
Are you cheating on me [Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go little kitty cat
I think it's time to go
Let's go little kitty cat
He don't want no mo'
Let's go little kitty cat
Quite frankly: no more givin' it
I'm not feelin' it

[Verse 1]
It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives 

[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body 
You don't want my body, body 
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body 
What about my body, body 
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty

Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there

If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care

If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Verse 2]
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care 
That's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust 
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, whoa

If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman." That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

Oh Oh Oh I

[Verse 2]
If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

[Bridge]
If there's options, i don't want them. They're not worth
My time cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you

Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

[Chorus][Intro: Beyonc ]
In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine 

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus, the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries
Which sign is best for me 

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all

Hey, I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
(Rewind)
I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
I want him sexy like a Scorpio
The way he holds me close, yeah
Sensitive as a Cancer
Every sign from coast to coast

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
I can't explain why I love him
Bossy like Leo's do
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he's been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh

Every sign from the first to the last (Ohh)
Everyday of the month has its good and its bad
(Everyday of the month)
I love you all, all twelve signs

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh

When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer

I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying

Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di  (Cause we like to party)

Living young, wild and free[Verse 1]
You re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you re snatching every bit of strength
That I m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it s a heart-breakin' situation I m up in, but I can t control

[Chorus]
You re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You re just like poison and I just don t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right 
I m not sure of what to do
It s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don t want it, but I do
You re just like poison
My affliction, I m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I m alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down 
How many doses am I needing now 
What s the prognosis, will you be around 
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down 

[Chorus]
Baby, you re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You re just like poison and I just don t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right 
I m not sure of what to do
It s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don t want it, but I do
You re just like poison
My affliction, I m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Bridge]
It s just not my body (no)
It s my mind
You don t know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don t need you (no, I don t need you, no)
It s so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what s good is that when you re not always there
(there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus]
You re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You re just like poison and I just don t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right 
I m not sure of what to do
It s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don t want it, but I do
You re just like poison
My affliction, I m addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

[Chorus]
You re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You re just like poison and I just don t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right 
I m not sure of what to do
It s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don t want it, do
You re just like poison
I m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die[Intro]

You got me looking so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Baby, your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me

Baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung, but I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
Oh you got me, you got me...

[Verse 2]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Eh, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
(Your love) Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in lo-o-o-ve
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in lo-o-o-ve

Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh

And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body
All I'm thinking 'bout is getting bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you

Won't you get me bodied

Won't you get me bodied (Hey)[Verse 1]
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight 
Would it give me some light 
Should I wait for you to call 
Is there any hope at all 
Are you drifting by 

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Verse 2]
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Bridge]
I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know 
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear[Intro: Beyonc ]

Ayo love you need to calm down over something small
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine
She a custie, word life, she love my shit
I know Kianna told words, she saw us both in the whip
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ass
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got hard who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'mma do these dishes and wash my ass cus I ain't gotta lie to you
Cus I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
So since I'm not your everything

Replacing you is so easy

I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you

Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Verse 2]
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me

[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground

And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run

I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

[Chorus]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

[Verse 2]
I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there 
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well, I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

[Chorus]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

[Bridge]
I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

[Breakdown]
Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life[Intro]

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 1]
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 2]
Certainly you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course you can come and see me, boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin' you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset 
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mmm, mmmm

[Verse 3]
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin''
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face, baby
The first time I said no

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes[Hook: Beyonc  & JAY-Z]

Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like

They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk

My way of thinking is slightly off

Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche

Waited for you to use the key

My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appears your face

Going outta my head, I think I'm losing all my mind

Took me a while, but I'm finally here

Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)

[Chorus: Walter Williams Sr.]
Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me

[Verse: Beyonce + Choir]
I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me

They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)

[Chorus: Beyonce + Choir]
Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)

The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

[Bridge: Choir]
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)

[Verse: Choir + Beyonce]
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame

[Chorus]
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me

[Bridge]
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong

And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive

Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us

[Verse 5: Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Elbows so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

[Verse 6: Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up

I'm trying to beat this emptiness, but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can barely stand
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home 
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.[Intro: Announcer]

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I'm in my penthouse half naked, I cooked this meal for you naked, so where the hell you at 
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass, don't make me break it
I wish that you were me, so you could feel this feeling, I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest, now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc ]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Queen B I'm tripping 'cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off
'Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning
Know I do the same shit but girl, it's different
And if I can't, you can't fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras, you just love making me jealous
Hanging out with your girls all night and staying out 'til tomorrow
Girl, you got me all kinda crazy, sipping all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas, girl, I'm jealous

[Chorus: Beyonc  & Chris Brown]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Oh woah)
Oh, I'm jealous (Jealous)
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Mine)
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc  & Chris Brown]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes (Yeah)
Do the type of things that I never ever do (Never do)
So I take one look in the mirror (Mirror) and I say to myself ('Self)
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this," no, no, no

[Bridge: Beyonc , Chris Brown & Both]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing (Oh)
That ain't nothing (Oh)
I'm just jealous (Jealous)
I'm just human (Human)
Don't judge me

[Chorus: Beyonc  & Chris Brown]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Don't judge me)
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Oh, ooh)

I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

[Chorus]
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security

You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why 
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyonc , I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

[Chorus]
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why 
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced

Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities

Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me 
Can't stop my tears from falling

I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye, boy, bye"
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

[Verse 3]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got...

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast  She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it
(Me, myself, and I) Sing it
(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) Found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) Sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Right, ladies  Yes

[Verse 4]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my woadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair[Verse 1]
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

[Chorus]
I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

[Verse 2]
Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love 
Love
Wasn't it beautiful 

[Chorus]
Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

[Bridge]
Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)

Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man

Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart

All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry

And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending

Ooh

All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all

Don't you worry 'bout a club

I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Take some time out, starting with today
For my babe

Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend
All of this fortune, boy, I owe you

Taking time out, starting with today

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come 
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come

Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm[Verse 1]
When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed

And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life

I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind

[Pre-Hook]
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song (Oh, yeah, yeah)
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known (Oh, yeah)
When you smiled, you smiled (Oh)
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

[Hook: Beyonce]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya

For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I wanted more then just a man

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me  (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..

[Hook][Verse 1]
I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching

[Chorus]
I'm kissing you
Oh

Deep inside of me yea

I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only

Haaa..by popular demand Sasha Feirce, Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo rude boy, why you cross me like a little t 
I'm Minaj, big M, uh'uh not a Mickey D
Now, I'm flyer than a broom (broom), broom, I dissed him
Then I peel up in a room (room), boomin' system
Now listen, now listen, LISTEN
I was there through your bid in prison
Ya know, I coulda been your wife
But sucks for you, boo-hoo
I would never rent a tux for you
Excuse me, I'm buzzing like bumblebees
Football & they all wanna fumble me
I was a thirty-two D in my Dugarees
Can I have a couple more cucumbers, please 
Now I'm that bitch, now I'm the bad witch
I need a lot of cheese up on my sandwich
Just got a new boyfriend, he's Pepe Le Pew
And he just bought me two Giuseppe shoes. (thank you!)
That's one for right, & one for the left
Yes to the left, left, to the left
Now we should all go to Jerry Springer
And you could put the ring up on my middle finger

[Beyonce]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, hey -
And just like a ghost
You'll be gone, gone
Diddy Bop, like Sean, John, John
Anyway, I like Lauren Lon-don
Get my chopsticks, get me my won-ton
Cus you thought you'd win
But I'd knew you'd lose
Honey, I'm flyer than altitude crews
Yes, I'm cool, you can chuck deuce
Nicki been hot since Duck, Duck Goose

[Beyonc :]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)[Intro]
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
C-c-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Listen

[Chorus]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I-I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Verse]
Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your crew was talking lip
Guess what I did  Smack that trick
Smack that trick
Guess what I did  (Smack that trick)
Gold everything, gold ass fangs
Gold ass chains, gold ass things
You can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
You can-you can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life, bitch

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro][Verse 1]
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation 
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

[Chorus]
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Verse 2]
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change 
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

[Chorus]
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Bridge]
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

[Outro]
Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you are when that digital pop
I stop the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world, stop[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
You need to stop for a minute
(No no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman

{Outro: Beyonc }
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me[Intro]
A gift from virgo

[Verse 1]
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now

[Verse 2]
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

[Verse 3]
Do you remember our first kiss 
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together 
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

[Chorus]
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye

[Bridge]
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you[Intro 1: 50 Cent]

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy made me dance and daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
We rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
That's when daddy looked at me

[Chorus: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the Bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(Texas)

[Verse 2: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment"
Oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool, but daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said, "Remember..."
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dixie Chicks]
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And that's when daddy looked at me

[Chorus: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the Bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Hey
Texas
Texas
Ooh, ooh, oh

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc ]
I think, I think, I think, I think
This your song, this your song!
Put your hands together now

[Verse 3: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
They sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard
They got money, but they don't have Cash
They got Junior, but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think, I think

[Outro: Beyonc  & Dixie Chicks]
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you"
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you
(He's playing you)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
"Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking
Turn it, turn it
Ay, turn up!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm so drunk in with love with her
Her double Ds spilling out my double cup
And she say champagne ain't strong enough
But she never real say ain't long enough
When I lift up all that Herve Leger
You see expression like it's be amazing there
Whatever you do better watch my hair
Too late, oups baby, you made it there
She try to take it there
And I swerve all over in that Rolls Royce on the way to my house
And shorty been drinking like a fish all night, wanna hit it right now
No Merlot, just camel toe, slap all on my handy ball
Ok, handcuffs, ain't no fan of those
But you ain't gonna need any hands at all
Now don't take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until it's hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till it's hard to breathe
Ok, you're not dealing with inexperience, promise I'm giving you pipe
Learn it, if I keep pouring up you keep throwing back
Shots will be in the air all night

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby 
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby 
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
Drunk in love, we be all night
All night

[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyonc ]
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good good

Drank drank drank it
Drank drank drank it
It's good
Surfing all of this good
Drunk in lo-oooove
Drunk in lo-oooove
All night
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
Hold up
That D'USS   is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that 3rd, wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby know I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Annie Mae!"
I'm nauseous, for y'all to reach these heights you gon' need G3

Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it

Never tired, never tired

That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

Boy I'm drinking

We be all night, love, love
Boy I'm drinking
We be all night, love, love
Drank drank drank it
Boy I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check   a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new

Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Sing it, y'all

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you 
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine

Hopin' that you see the signs
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Lemonade all the time, keep that in mind
Formation, formation
Exclamation, formation
Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Obviously guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!

Hear me out
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you 
Cause I need freedom too![Verse 1]
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine 

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world 

[Verse 2]
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life 
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world  (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

[Verse 3]
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world  (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight 
I want y'all to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called "Bow Down"

[Verse: Beyonc ]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of bein' in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Bow down bitches, bow-bow down bitches (Hey)

Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground[Verse 1]
Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you outta know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

[Verse 4]
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie "Baby you're my flame"
He givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth

[Verse 5]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy won't you treat him right

[Verse 6]
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Hollywood
Welcome to Hollywood[Beyonce]
Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

[Mos Def]
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back

[Beyonce]
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that

[Mos Def]
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'

[Sam Sarpong]
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'

[Beyonce]
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them 
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve 
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

[Mos Def]
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

[Sam]
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

[Beyonce]
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style

[Hook x2]
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)

[Beyonce]
Eyes like the ocean

[Mos Def]
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'

[Beyonce]
Hair like forever

[Sam]
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

[Beyonce]
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

[Mos Def]
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking

[Sam]
Chickenheads cluckin'

[Beyonce]
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel

[Mos Def]
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile

[Beyonce]
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show[Narration: Beyonc ]

I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it

Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown

You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible

I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know 
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist

You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life[Intro]
OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 1]
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 2]
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Bridge]
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
I took you back all those times
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
(You lost yo mind!)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find 
(Hey!)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind[Verse 1]
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Verse 2]
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you 
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Bridge]
Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman )
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you[Intro: Big Boi]

A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach

He better call Becky with the good hairAs a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family[Letra de "Si Yo Fuera Un Chico"]

[Verso 1]
Si yo fuera un chico
S lo por una vez
Yo me vestir a como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy

Cada noche a mentir

Nos vence nuestra seducci n

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those 
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verse 2]
Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue till they hear me spit
Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those 
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Bridge]
For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious 
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verso 1: Beyonc  & Alejandro Fern ndez]
Ven y qu date conmigo
Dame el coraz n vida m a estoy muriendo lento en mi prisi n
Anda dime lo que sientes quitate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
Y despu s te llevare hasta donde quieras sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya se a donde voy

[Coro: Alejandro Fern ndez & Beyonc ]
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La  nica llave de tu destino
El que te cuida m s que a su vida
Soy tu ladr n
Soy tu gitana, tu compa era
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el coraz n
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor

[Verso 2: Beyonc  & Alejandro Fern ndez]
Yo nac  para tus ojos, para nadie m s
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, coraz n de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
Y despu s te llevare hasta donde quiera
Sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga porque ya se a donde voy

Nuestro amor[Verse 1]
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care  Well, that's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now every time our love goes sour, you can't sympathize, baby
You see these tears falling down to my ear
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care  Well, that's okay
Listen, hey

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust 
Now you're just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh, do-do-do do do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh, hey

I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Outro]
I still care, baby
I still care, yeah
I still care
La-la-la, la-la-la[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how it's looking, babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue 
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc  all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor[Intro]

Hold that cup like alcohol, hold that cup like alcohol
Hold that cup like alcohol, don't you drop that alcohol
Never drop that alcohol, never drop that alcohol
I know I'm thinkin' 'bout alcohol, I know I'm thinkin' 'bout that alcohol

[Verse 2]
Man this feel like rollin' dice, damn this feel like rollin' dice
Seven eleven, seven eleven, seven twice, man, seven twice

Ooh wee Bey be freaky deaky, think me see she pink bikini
Rock that groovy dye dashiki, Nefertiti, edges kinky
Sweatin' out my blow out, sweatin' out my press

Fresher than you, fresher than you
Fresher than you, ohDeena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do 
To have ya'll hatin on me
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet

Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth 
(What you hate me for )
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But i'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life 
And let me live mine

Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth 
(What you hate me for )
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know

I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth

I'm so tired of all of these lies

And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American

Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today

Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A

Tonight I m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)

Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That s why I m backin  this thing back
Pop poppin  this thing back

For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won t never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don t thank you enough

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey Shawty show me that you love the way, that I do
Whatever, to show the world I m crazy bout you
I tell them everything amazing bout you
The reason behind me saying I do
It s hidden in the way you toot it in the air and drop it down
And give it to me dirty when nobody ain t around
Your legs in the air and your clothes on the ground
And your head in the pillow, trying to hold in the sound
Now come here Shawty, let me grab and hold that
Remote control that, I love to rock when you you there for me
I want you to know that, when you undressing
It s like I m living out a fantasy
Cause you so soft, and I m not that
You want this, well you got that
Magnum lifestyle, know I m bout that
That Bentley, lay you on top that
Knock that ass from here to tomorrow
On the balcony, out in Cabo
Know a shopping spree will follow
I m in love, watching you model
Couple candle lights, create the ambiance
And yo lingerie and yo Louis Vuitton
Pussy sick and slow music on
And I m watching you like it s a movie yo

[Hook: Beyonce][Verse 1]
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Verse 2]
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Bridge]
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

[Verse 3]
When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn 
Because you're the one that I depend upon

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you....

[Hook]
Boy, I'm - I'm on your runway
And I don't never wanna come back
Put my name on your T-shirt

Coachella, you ready 
Let's go get 'em
Yes! So crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, yes, B
History in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so, looking so, looking so

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Drop it

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
(B)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is ")
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
The beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now (So, crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Coachella)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now (Y'all dance with me, come on)

[Interlude: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes[Intro: Beyonce (Ghostface Killah)]
Ahh, ahh, ahh all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(Uh-huh... Toney Starks..
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo )

[Beyonce]
I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Beyonce]
So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got..

[Hook 2X]

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself)
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way)
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again)

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah *during hook*]
See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now..
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry..
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot..
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset

[Ghostface Killah]
Changes... we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die

I'm a world wide woman
I'm a world wide woman
I'm a world wide woman

Every time I paint, it sharpens my harmony
Yesterday I tried to paint you

Love, Beyonc [Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this 
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy 
Jealous or crazy 
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride 
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy 
Jealous or crazy 
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

What's up, what's up, what's up[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
This is ladies night, once again it's on!
Ya man actin' up  Then leave him home!
It's the girl the industry call the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of piranhas
Courvoisier in my left arm, glass in my other hand
While I rock that coochie like a rubber band
I'm feelin' sexy in my million dollar Vicki bra
Ay yo Beyonce, how you feelin' ma

We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to partyPt. 1 Love Drought

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
Do you remember being born 
Are you thankful for the hips that cracked, the deep velvet of your mother
And her mother and her mother 

You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
You desperately want to look like her.
How to wear your mother's lipstick
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face.

Your mother is a woman,
And women like her can not be contained.

I think of lovers as trees
Growing to and from one another,
Searching for the same light.
Why are you afraid of love 
I think it's not possible for someone like you.
But you are the love of my life (the love of my life)

[Verse]
Ten times out of nine, I know you re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me 
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me 
Like on my worst day  Or am I not thirsty, enough 
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

[Chorus]
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Pt. 2 Sandcastles

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
If we're gonna heal
We gonna start again,
You are the magician pulling me back together again,
The way you cut me in half.

Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Her heaven would be a love without betrayal.
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.

[Verse]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way

[Outro]
There is a curse,
That will be broken.
One thousand girls raise their arms.
Now that reconciliation is possible,
If we gonna heal,
Let it be glorious.[Intro: Bug a Boos]
Let's go
Woo
Fresh, fresh
Break it down
Let's go, ayy
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse: Choir]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Choir]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Choir]
'Cause we like to party, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)

[Interlude: Beyonc ]
As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom[Intro - Beyonce]

[Outro]
I'm onto you, you must be haunting meWe need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more  commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.

Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal  These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible

We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities[Intro: Sean Paul & Beyonc ]

On A star

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow

I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never

And I'm wishin on a star
To follow where you are
And I'm wishing on a dream[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day "
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, ok" (Uh-huh, ok)
Could it be that you at the crib with another lady 
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
Baby why, why you gots to lie 
I'm all up in your game, boy, you better say my name, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth )
If somebody's there then tell me who, oh

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby (Hey, yeah)
Why the sudden change  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say  baby, I love you  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name, say my name (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You actin' kinda shady (Hey, yeah) ain't callin' me baby (Alright)

Oh, oh, oh-oh-ohI grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View. We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward. And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU. My college was Destiny's Child. My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher. I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers. I needed the vocalists. 'Cause I wanted different characters I didn't want us all doing the same thing. And the amount of swag is just limitless, like...  the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play and the drumrolls and the haircuts and the bodies and the... it's just not right. It's just so much damn swag[Beyonce]
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven

I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground 
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision

[Wyclef]
Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind

Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

[Beyonce]
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

[Rah Digga]
Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older

[Wyclef]
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky

[Beyonce]
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

[Wyclef]
Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize

[Beyonce]
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

[Wyclef]
Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie

[Beyonce]
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawnNorth America

[Verse 1]
Miente, lo ves
Es un juego
(Yo conozco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
Sabe decir lo que
Quieres o r
Un bello embustero
(solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

[Pre-Chorus]
A mi tambi n
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

[Chorus]
No nos pelearemos
No nos va a enga ar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
Nos va dividir  No!
No nos va a excitar
Vamos a sufrir 
Por un bello embustero

[Verse 2]
Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontr 
Bes ndote el cuello
(pero el no lo pod a creer las dos ca mos en su red)
Por qu  a ti 
Si hay mil por ah 
El es un perro
(las dos sin querer ca mos presas en su piel)

[Pre-Chorus]
A mi tambi n
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

[Bridge]
Lo cre a tan mio
Yo viv a por el
Fuimos un desaf o
Que pudo mas que el
Es un hombre muy fr o
No es de una mujer
Ya no nos puede enga ar
Haremos con su juego, ya basta... de sus mentiras
Dile adi s por las dos

[Chorus]
No nos pelearemos
No nos va a enga ar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
Nos va dividir  No!

Voy a olvidar tu amor [Intro: Beyonc  & Sister Nancy]
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
I see y'all in the front row, hey
Bam bam dilla, bam

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you 
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down

[Verse: Beyonc ]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, make that wood
Holly like the boulevardIf I were a boy
Even just for a day
I d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I d kick it with who I wanted
And I d never get confronted for it
Cause they d stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I d be a better man
I d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it s broken
So they d think that I was sleepin  alone
I d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she d be faithful
Waitin  for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I d be a better man
I d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you re just a boy
You don t understand
Yeah, you don t understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don t listen to her
You don t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you re just a boy

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you re just a boy
Yeah, you don t understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you re just a boy[Intro: Beyonc ]

I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone
Now we're finally alone
And some moments at the end of the day
Feel your touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness
I never want them to go away

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)

Wanna show you how to rock it
So this feelin last and
Make slow love slow love
Slow love slow love slow love all night

[Verse 2]
It is just a few little things
That you gotta know
A girl will give you all of her heart
When it's happening slow
I need a little laughter
And love will follow after
Lets take this chance to steal away
Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us
Tonight I really want you to stay

Can't you see the glow on the window pane 
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near, you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

Everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear

But finally you put me first

Coachella, thank you so much, I love youThere's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things



I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel

My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it  I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean '. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message[Beyonc  & Ne-Yo: Intro]
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

[Beyonc : Verse 1]
It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away
And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day

[Beyonc  & Ne-Yo: Hook]
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait

[Ne-Yo: Verse 2]
It's 12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them no, no, no
And I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!

[Beyonc  & Ne-Yo: Bridge]
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your absent in the borders is my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting

All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time

[Verse 2]
Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

[Chorus + (Backing Vocals)]
(It's my first time
Remember your first time
It's my first time)

[Outro]
It felt like[Verse 1]
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

[Verse 2]
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no

[Bridge]
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, controlMichelle,

Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.

She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!

No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.

She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways

Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.

Love

[Outro: Beyonc ]
I feel we made something that made my daughter proud
Made my mother proud, my father proud, and all of the people
That are my brothers and sisters around the world
And that's why I live
I'm so lucky and grateful that I'm able to
Take all these crazy ideas and actually make it into somethin' that
Heals people and that may spark vision in people
That shows them to dream big
And shows them that they are limitless
It's possible
If my country ass can do it, they can do it[Intro]

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

I love you, I love you, I love you
Dangerously in love
I love you, I love you, I love you

He loves me especially different
Everytime you keep me on my feet happily
Excited by your cologne, and your hands
Your smile, your intelligence
You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me
You school me, give me things to think about
Ignite me, you excite me
You love me and you like me
Incite me, Incite me to chorus

Larararilarara...
La la la la
Uh uh uh uh uh..
Dangerously In Love[Verse 1:]
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

[Chorus:]
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

[Verse 2:]
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

[Chorus:]
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company[Verse 1:]
I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me now she's there

[Verse 2:]
She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucker for love
Kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus:]
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

[Verse 3:]
I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain

[Verse 4:]
Sucker for love
Your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus:]
Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool
I'll still
Settle for you

[Chorus:]
I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you
Baby, yeaI wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Yea, history in the making
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
(Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my) pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I'm warmed up now, let's go
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (Oh, no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy, bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane "
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova 
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back Young, ever since I made the change over
To platinum, the game's been a wrap, one

[Verse 4: Beyonc ]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
Hey!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now

Got me looking so crazy in love**FINGERTIPS**

[Verse 1: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyonc ]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyonc ]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyonc ]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Beyonc ]
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Chorus: Beyonc , Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

[Guitar Break: Beyonc , Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
Come on play that thing Gary
Play that thing, play that thing, play that thing

[Chorus: Beyonc , Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

We Love You Stevie![Beyonce']
You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey

[Mekhi]
Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking

[Beyonce']
C'mon and touch me D I know you want to

[Mekhi]
Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal

[Beyonce']
I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now

[Mekhi]
You trying to act like I'm not a cop

[Beyonce']
You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style

[Mekhi]
Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists

[Beyonce']
But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal

[Mekhi]
I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill

[Beyonce']
So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel

I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now

[Mekhi]
Nah, I don't think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go

[Beyonce']
It ain't about getting locked
Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat

[Mekhi]
Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you

[Beyonce']
You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true

[Mekhi]
I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency

[Beyonce']
Go with your instincts and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only moments to see if it is to be...[Chorus]
Baby, you're the only man that I want

It's been a crazy afternoon
And I can't wait till I get home to you
Cause I've been thinking about you all day long
I hope you miss me boy, cause here I come

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to leave me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
Daddy used to tell me, "Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, but one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, but one day, I might not make it"

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
"But you just gotta find your way back

Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, had to run my race

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
"Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby

I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Verse 1:]
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired and I need a change

[First Channel:]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
And something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out (woah oh ho-ooh ooh)

But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Verse 2:]
You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's risen enough
You're time's expired

[Second Channel:]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
I gotta move around
If I ain't got a ring by now
That means I'm not tied down

Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out

I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next

I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

Come on to the next (oh oh)[Verse 1:]
I like to feel so high and you feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid and you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

[Verse 2:]
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

[Verse 3:]
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" signWhen I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I
I gotta move on

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'

To make themselves smaller
We say to girls:
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."

Please give it up for Larry and Laurent, Les Twins
Please give it up for my incredible background singers
Please give it up for my beautiful orchestra

That worked tirelessly to put this show together, we love you
Thank you to my family that's here tonight
Have a beautiful night
I love you from the bottom of my heart
God bless you, goodnight
Peace[Verse 1:]
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Verse 2:]
All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Verse 3:]
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Outro]
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be thereYou say that hes wrong you say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gona hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps always runnin the streets
He's playin the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real

No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man

You say you dont trust him b/c he been locked up
You say that he's trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say its for sure so he got a mistress
Until you can show me im gon' stand by him

No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh OhhThank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible[Chorus]

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal "
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you

Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what 
You buggin' Who 
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop

Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change 

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!

Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day 
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady 
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie 
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth 
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change 
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
(all my DC's fans!)
(yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

Ladies leave yo man at home(3x)
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce
Twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake
Work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist
You better dip that thing

I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The rock I'm rockin'

'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'

The house I live in

The car I'm driving
I bought it
Cause I depend on me
(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor (What )
I'm not gon give up
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you

Baby you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you

At night I fall asleep
And I dont wanna wake up

'cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation

In the body that
I only wanna share with you

Hey

[Chorus:]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you

Baby we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight lets get real intimate
Only you can satisfy my appetite
'cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

Ah Yeah
Time to come back home y`all
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Lil Zane, T-Bone, Both]
For God I`m a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave And also stuck in my ways Give Him praise
Words can`t express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don`t wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It`s time to come home

[Verse 2: Beyonc , Melba Moore & Angie Stone]
It doesn`t matter where you been Or what you did wrong
It doesn`t matter who you are  You`re always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes And you confess
If you committed any sin you`ll be forgiven

[Hook: Beyonc , Angie Stone & Melba Moore]

[Interlude]
Come on home
Come on come on home

[Verse 3: Angie Stone, Beyonc , Both]
If you can`t see your way out And you`re drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want But you still can`t find happiness
It`s when you feel like you`re forsaken Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home So your life can be cleansed

[Hook: Beyonc , Angie Stone & Melba Moore]
Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)

I`ve been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

[Bridge: Beyonc , Angie Stone & Melba Moore]
Don`t bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
The Redeemer`s here He`s gonna give you help (Give you help)
Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that`s heavy laden
Soul salvation, ooh

[Hook: Beyonc , Angie Stone & Melba Moore]

Time to come homeCan it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are

Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

I don't care if we on the run
Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway

I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up

If I were a boy

If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a, were a...

[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a...
If I were a boy
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Boy...

You ready B  Let's go get 'em
Look for me, Young, B, cruising down the Westside highway
Doing what we like to do, our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel
It's true to the heart, she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us 
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keeping me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
Now they 'bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It won't be that, oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walking this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working at Kermain, Birkin Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody takes my place
Yeah-hee

(Break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me

Ughh taxi come pick this nigga up; a used condom in his truck
Used to trick it wit tha sluts; tellin me i'm number 1
But u was better than tha rest; truth be told u'z a mess
Who loved tha playin games; rollercoaster wit my brain

Changin my number; i ain't thinkin bout you
Im in love wit myself; if u wanna kno tha truth

(Beyonce:)
In tha closet.. that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it babii please dont touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me

(Beyonce & Trina:)
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii

(Trina:)
Keep talkin slick...
Ones a killa; ones a drug deala
One who wines *&* dines me wit million dollar even tho rap it to equality
I even kno a rapper who wanna dig in it
Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle
Who ain't neva had a hard time aimin at tha middle
MY NBA All Star who make it wit a sizzle
That's tha shizzle my nizzle; he think his time when he nibble
Don't make me remind u; to tha left, to tha left

(Beyonce:)
Everythin u own in tha box to tha left
In tha closet.. that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it babii please dont touch
And keep talkin that mess, that's fine
But could u walk and talk at tha same time
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

So, go ahead and get gone

Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't kno
What did u think I was putting u out for 
Cause u was untrue
Rolling her around in tha car that I bought u
Baby u dropped them keys; hurry up before ur taxi leaves
Standing in tha front yard telling me

So, don't u ever for a second get to thinkin; u're irreplaceableeee[Verse 1]
Babe
Gotta know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A girl like me, see I don't play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me, go all the way
Do what you gotta do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake  (tell me)

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby 
Wanna get to know me 
What's really good, baby 
Do you have a lady 
Been near the hood lately 
Where you from and where you be 
What's good with you, baby 
What's good with you, baby 

[Verse 2]
Babe
You're sittin' over there, tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now, don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, no no
Where do we go 
What this thing could be, we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go (tell me)

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby 
Wanna get to know me 
What's really good, baby 
Do you have a lady 
Been near the hood lately 
Where you from and where you be 
What's good with you, baby 
What's good with you, baby 

[Bridge]
Don't try playing with my mind
Boy, I don't have no time
For something that I know ain't good for me
Don't hesitate to say
You feel the chemistry
I wanna know, should I take a chance with you 

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby 
Wanna get to know me 
What's really good, baby 
Do you have a lady 
Been near the hood lately 
Where you from and where you be 
What's good with you, baby 
What's good with you, baby 

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby 
Wanna get to know me 
What's really good, baby 
Do you have a lady 
Been near the hood lately 
Where you from and where you be 
What's good with you, baby 
What's really good, baby 

[Outro]
What's good with you, baby

Hello world, well I just bought here
My dress: Paris
My shoes: Rome
My fur: House of Dereon and
My fragrance: Diamonds
Well, I love Paris and I love Rome
But I always know when I'm away too long
Is when I start missing the man at home

I'm your dream girl boys
I'm back, are you happy 
I'm your dream girl boy
Show me how you care

I'm your dreamgirl boys how I hated to leave you
If you wanna keep me, all you gotta do is:
Hold me, touch me, squeeze me
Love me, leave me crusty, dress me, undress me

Remember those walls I built 
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo

Burnin' through my darkest night

Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame

When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is " look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby

We stepping in hotter this year
We stepping in hotter this year
I know you gon' like it
I know you gon' like it
I'm stepping in hotter this year
I'm stepping in hotter this year
So don't you fight it
So don't you fight itI see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time



I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening



I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
If you w re a boy
Then, girl, you'd understand
You need to stop list nin' to your friends
Love, respect, and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as I'm comin' home to you
And give you the world

[Pre-Chorus: R Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you don't have a clue, babe
How I work and pay the bills
How everything I do is for you
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Chorus 2: Beyonc  (R. Kelly)]
If I were a boy (If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone (I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

[Post-Chorus: R. Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man

[Chorus: Beyonc  & (R. Kelly)]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed (Said I'm sorry)

[Bridge: Beyonc  & R. Kelly]
It's a little too late for you to come back
But I can't let you go, 'cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro: Beyonc ]
But you're just a boy[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built 
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
(Halo, halo, I can see your halo)
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

Whoa, oh, ohI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick "
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now 
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever doneWE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE KILLINGS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY  STOP KILLING US. 

WE DON'T NEED SYMPATHY. WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.

WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.

THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.

THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.

THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.

FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.

WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.

WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

CLICK IN TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN YOUR AREA. YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD.

 BEYONC [Verse]
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers doRemember those walls I built

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care 
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I punch out hits, like Sugar Shane the new suga the game

And paid suger bills, now she calls me suga daddy
Cause I come through stunt in that suga white Cady
Bubble brown suga body Angelo

Now she mad at Quence, cause of the game I run
So she wanna chew me out like suga the gum
But competition is nothin' so you really can't see me
Cause suga, I'm on a level that higher then Don Bredes
So you can eat your wheaties, Pop some suger smacks
Or sweeten up your coffee with dozen of suger packs
You still ain't no match for kid from Melby
When they sprinkle the club with more gees and suga tee
And yes indeed, he gots to be the all topsy
That killed the summer in that drop top B
So on the close n' open', forget the rope n' dough
Cause suga ain't knock em out, with the dopest quotes
Uh, uh

Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook: Beyonc ]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu

Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having D j  Vu

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
It's history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is " look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (oh no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy, bring ya whole set
Jay Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "hey is he insane " (Oh no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova 
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back Young, ever since I made the change over
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one

[Verse 4: Beyonc ]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It s only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I m not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I m more than what
You ve made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

[Verse 2]
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I m screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I m not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my ownIf I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I d kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I d be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin  for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I d be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you re just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you're just a boy
Yeah, you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boyCarmen why you bugin', this ain't time for lovin'

Aw baby, how you doin' 
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh 
Some women were made...
But me, myself 
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you 
You feel me 

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why 
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes 
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

I kno I got it but don't flaunt it even though brothas want it
Dancin' dirrty while I'm flirtin, 'cause he' checkin' up on me

You can find me in the club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care 
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No D j  Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming 
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that 
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no

Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip, or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for

Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me

Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Part 2, it's so crazy right now

(Verse 1 - Beyonce)
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cuz I know I don't understand
Just how your love your doing no one else can

(Chorus - Beyonce)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

(Verse 2 - Beyonce)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is  Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

(Chorus - Beyonce)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in
Love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey!)
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's, (hey)
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

I'm Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Check it, let's go

The genuine article I go I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo

Crazy bring ya whole set
Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane, (oh
No)
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova 
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)

(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over

To platinum the game's been wrap, One!

(Bridge - Beyonce)
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cuz your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby

I love the way you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

If I let you go

Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call

If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you 
Why would you risk it, baby 
Is that the price I that pay 
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things 
(See all the things, see all the things)

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)

Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for 
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why 
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes 
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me
Why 
Damn

[Chorus]
I love his big ego
He talk like this 'cause he could back it up...
Talk, talk like this 'cause he could back it up...
He could back it up, 'cause, he could back it up

He talk like this 'cause he could back it up...
Talk, talk like this 'cause he could back it up...
I love his big ego[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could ve been
But still ,you live inside of me
So tell me how is that 
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you re the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don t wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don t want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I m no broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I want to put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you re in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath with out my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Smash into you

Smash into youAnd then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

[Verse 2]
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud 
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria[Intro: Beyonc ]
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3: Beyonc ]
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4: Beyonc ]
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide 

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this 

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)

[Verse 1: Beyonc ]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for 

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I'mma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill

I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

They call shots, I call audibles

It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn 
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga please don't touch

And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmm)

Everything you own in the box to the left

I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags
We're finished
Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable[Chorus]

And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames

When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke

And not see all the things that I kept only just for you 
Why would you risk it, baby

How could you look at me
And not see all the things

[Verse 1]
Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us

I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me

Kiss me
Hold me

Speechless[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide 

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this 

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this 

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke 
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own

If I let you go

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gone love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Why would you risk it baby is that the price I that pay 
Cause this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
(See all the things)
(See all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go

Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)

If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go

        Remember those walls I built

Well baby they're tumbling down

And they didn't even put up a fight

They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in

But I never really had a doubt

Standing in the light of your halo

I've got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm takin'

I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

Woah...

Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning through my darkest night

You're the only one that I want

Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like fallin'

Gravity can't forget

To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

The risk that I'm takin'

I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see you halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

Halooooo ouuuu

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm  a bitch in the afternoon
Every  now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever  complex in every way
And  all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

[Hook]
I  don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And  that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Verse 2]
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

[Hook]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And yes, that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
Oh!I'm feelin sexy
I want to hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-why
I might just take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin so crazy babe

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide 

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

As he guzzle my jugs
Gotta make this shit apparent
Cause this ass is a drug
And TSA wanna check I ain't smuggling crack
I I I came on his face and then he blew out my back
Surveying my clit for best line of attack
Bomb pussy gives him flashbacks, he served in Iraq
My rack is pillows that he rest on before round 3
My stomach is painting, cum on canvas, cum on me
My head so good he call these the bees knees
Driver roll up the partition please

[Outro]
See you gotta work it out[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Beyonc ]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now  I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I  used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now  be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The  audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyonc ]
Baby,  seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc ]
Boy,  I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyonc ]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's D j  Vu

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference 
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever  That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No D j  Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

[Bridge: Beyonc ]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having D j  Vu 

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc ]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide 

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this 

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain

Remember those walls I built 
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight

Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

Burnin' through my darkest night

But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

        I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby 
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby 
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen " Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up , boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen " Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)
That D'USS  is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice!
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
We be all night (we be all night) love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing, that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

        [Verse 1]
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

[Versus 2]
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

[Bridge]
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo

I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go

Don't you ring the alarm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you 
Why would you risk it, baby 
Is that the price I that pay 
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things 
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

        If it's what you truly want
I can wear her skin over mine, her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves, her teeth as confetti
Her scalp, a cap
Her sternum, my bedazzled cane
We can pose for a photograph, all three of us

And while you dance, I'ma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue

Aw baby, how you doin' 
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh 
Some women were made...
But me, myself 
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you 
You feel me 

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why 
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes 
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Hook]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)

He got a big ego
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Bridge]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know 
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...

Hood By Air[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into youI tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating 
Are you cheating on me Being black maybe that the reason why they always mad...

        At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
