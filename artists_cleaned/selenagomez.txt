[Verse 1]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

[Verse 2]
I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

[Bridge]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah

[Outro]
And now the chapter is closed and done
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I d go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin  and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin' 
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use 
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next 
Can we focus on the love 
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go

[Verse 2]
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you 
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what it s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other

But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to 

[Chorus]
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself

Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

I m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

I m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

You've been so distant from me lately

Don t even wanna call you "baby"

Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (Upstairs)
Why you act like I m not there 
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare 
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I m special (So special), yeah

Why you and I are not succeeding, ah-ah (Mmm, ah, ah)

Chills

[Verse 1]
New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watching me
Shivers dance down my spine, head down to my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

[Post-Chorus]
Giving me chills
Chills

[Verse 2]
Sunset Tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened that Bordeaux from 1993

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees

Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away just like (You're giving me chills)
Take my breath away just like a souvenir
Giving me chills

Take my breath away just like a souvenir[Verse 1]
If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it 
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it 
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it  Would you grow it 
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it 

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before 
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

[Verse 2]
If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it 
(Would you even wanna take it  Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it 
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it 
(Would you wanna make it, would you wanna make it )
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it  (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before 
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You re willing to fight, to be right

And no war in anger
Was ever won

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me 
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew

Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So lemme tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Livin' out of the scene, out in the wild
Learnin' to breathe
Up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holdin' hands with the darkness and knowin' my heart is allowed
Allowed

Is there a place where I can hide away 
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away

So much to see, I'm in paradise, oh, I
Always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now, baby, born to fly, oh, I
Now see, how could it be 
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek, ooh-ee

Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for fourteen-hundred-sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messin' with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love

Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind 
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

[Verse 2]
How does she touch you  Can I try it, too 
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

[Bridge]
I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that
(Let me get that, yeah)
And baby, once I get it, I'm yours, no take-backs
Gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever, you're mine
Baby, I'm addicted, no lie, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
So baby, whenever you're ready...

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
This love will be the death of me
But I know I'll die happily
I'll know, I'll know, I'll know
Because you love me so
Yeah

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
(I'm gonna get it, yeah yeah)
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
(When you're ready, when you're ready
Come and get it, get it)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na[Verse 1]
We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Verse 2]
Why is it so different when we wake up 
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Bridge]
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Outro]
You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober[Intro]
I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

[Verse 1]
I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Verse 2]
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival, revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Bridge]
This won't take too long, you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Outro]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival[Verse 1]
Like a prayer surroundin' us, movin' effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight, it's for free
No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Verse 2]
Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark, I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest (My, my mind)
While my body reflects (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now (Get up), I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 

[Bridge]
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to be free (Ooh)
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to see me (Ooh, down, ooh)
(Get down) Don't get me, oh (Down, oh)
(Get down) Don't get me (Ooh)
(Get down) Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Chorus]
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh, I won't let me get me)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now (Get up), I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out[Verse 1]
Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste
Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seein' through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, you're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your babe
And now you're treatin' me like I'm insane
You're insane

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (You're kind of crazy)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (You're kind of crazy)

[Outro]
Hmm, I don't know[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna to be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
(Yes please)

[Verse 2]
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed!
(That's what I said)

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not... what it seems[Intro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lows and the highs
She didn't know if she was gonna survive
It all got so much better with time

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Verse 2]
She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her 'cause what I would say
"Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place"

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I tried to tell her

[Bridge]
(Ah)
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have a choice before it gets too dark
(Ah)
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice

[Chorus]
She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons (Hey)
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need the second-guessing (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Outro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you, I tried to tell her)
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)[Verse 1]
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow 
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow 
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song

Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Bridge]
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning

You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

[Interlude]
It's The Cataracs

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Outro]
How do I do it 
It's The Cataracs
Ha ha ha[Verse 1]
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Verse 2]
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Bridge]
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

[Chorus / Outro]
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls[Verse 1]
This is just what the doctor ordered (Yeah)
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry
I'm a sensitive situation (Mmm)
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications (Mmm)
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Can we keep it on a first name basis  (Ah)
We could overcrowd each other's spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm gettin' impatient (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh

Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
You look like
You don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown
And it's just not right, but you look like
You don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it's just not right that you look like

[Outro]
Fun (Yeah, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun[Verse 1]
Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die 

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Verse 2]
Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die 

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride[Verse 1]
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever led me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

[Verse 2]
No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't want nothing else
Not when I had the best
I don't want nothing else
Because you showed me the best

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh[Verse 1]
You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up that bad kind of love
Is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh[Produced by: Matt Man & Da Robin]

[Verse 1]
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know

I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

[Verse 1]
Now's all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
You said you loved me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that 
What happened to that 
All your promises and all them plans we had
What happened to that 
What happened to that

What happened, what happened, what happened to that 

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Bridge]
Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart

You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Verse 2]
The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Bridge]
So even when your bones feel like weights
And it s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It ll be alright, they re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise[Verse 1]
There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

[Verse 2]
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in

Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne

Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in

What I'm saying, what I'm saying
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level, this is the remix

[Verse 1]
You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

I am so sick, I'm hoping you notice, yeah baby
So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why love's a lie

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up

Swear it drives me crazy
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry, baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die, baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry, baby
Thought you were my ride or die, baby

Everything
Is not
What it seems

[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
That the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
Yes, please
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed
That's what I said

[Refrain]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

[Verse 2]
There's always a lotta people that you need to see
But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful of who's aware of your reality
You know what I mean!
There's a whole other world that you only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head to toe
But understand, it's not the status quo
Oh, careful what you show!

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

[Breakdown]
Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh
Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
Uh, oh!
Things are getting kind of tricky
But it doesn't mean much to a girl like me
'Cause I can do the things that you'll never believe
Even in your wildest dreams
Well, excuse me
I know it's strange, but true
In my opinion, from my point of view
But once in a blue moon, I don't know what to do
It's like a catch-22

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

[Outro]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not
What it seemsSnippet

(Yeah, here, you're here, you're here
Higher, higher, higher, higher)

[Verse: Selena Gomez & Halsey]
Heaven in the valley, in the valley
Baby, it's higher, we did a
Hundred going into the night
And every day, you make a
Promise It'll be better in time
Can you tell me 
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on 
'Cause my time, my time is running out

[Outro: Selena Gomez & Halsey]
I've been  in my body, in my body
Baby, it's higher, we did a

Can you tell me 
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on 
'Cause my time, my time is running out[Verse 1]
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world

You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos
Low life in this high too
You give me love with an attitude
I throw the drink and the glass through
I see your ex and some brand new
I pack my bags and I'm leaving you

'Cause you've been nothing but bad news, bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news

Fuck me right over
Do what I had to

Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Fire, it could go and burn you out
A broken hourglass, scattered pieces on the ground
Desire, It could leave you reachin' out
With nothing left, just ashes to be found

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch you walk away, and that's okay
'Cause love is never promised anyway, anyway

[Chorus]
It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain
This selfish game
It's just wild love

[Verse 2]
We were flyin', faster than the speed of sound
I went left, you went right, but the heavy winds brought us down
Do you ever wonder how chaos, it works out
In the sea of confusion, happiness and doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch you walking out, and that's okay
I guess as long as you got a heart, you got something to break, to break

It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain
This selfish game
It's just wild love

[Bridge]
Ain't it funny, how the world when there's a thrill
So we jump on again
It may be sweet, but it can kill, and we don't care
We'll take our chance again
'Til the bitter end, on and on again
That's how the story goes, mmm

It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain

'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

[Bridge]
Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will, I'm all about
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

[Chorus]
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way[Verse 1]
Happier times flash through my mind
We both say it's over, and I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

[Chorus]
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

[Verse 2]
I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me

[Chorus]
It's a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

[Bridge]
The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over
In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

[Chorus]
Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play

[Chorus]
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe, you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Look at the magic glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night, you can fly (Fly)

[Chorus]

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home

Rise to the heights of all you can be (Fly, fly)
Soar on the hope of marvellous things

[Chorus]

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings

Watching you from underneath a rock

In the dark, we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know
In your lips, I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

[Chorus]
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

When you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (ah, oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2: Kah-Lo & Selena Gomez]
Thinking, reminiscing
My night's pretty lit, but it's just you missing
Wishing I could be the light in your life
The way still light might bleed through night
Thoughts of you on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 3: Kah-Lo & Selena Gomez]
I should be baby-girl living, I know we left messy, but it all is forgiven
Ringing your line, hoping it will go through, and maybe one more time, we could talk this through
Go back to you
Thoughts of you are on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

(Go back to you, go back to you)

[Outro: Selena Gomez]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you[Verse 1]
All I need is love
That s what you give
I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That s what I feel when your skin's on mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

[Chorus]
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

[Verse 2]
All I need is true
That's what you are when everything's a lie
All I need is here, right where you are
You're every reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter

[Verse 1]
Telling in the night
Miss you in the dark
Thought the opposite
But I was worth it
Wanted to say
I'm holding on
But I remember when
We were perfect
Perfect, perfect
I remember when
We were perfect

[Chorus]
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head

[Verse 2]
It hurts to say goodbye
I'll see you in my dreams
I couldn't heal your scars
We tried to make believe
You say the perfect things
But do the opposite
I wonder if you even know you're talking shit
You wanna build a bridge now
But I'm over it
I took the boulder on your shoulder
Then I sculpted it
Lying in your bed
Instead of to my face
But some things you do
Can't be erased

[Chorus]
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my headLyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned![Verse 1]
You know how to please me
Whispering my name out loud
Early in the morning
Lying on the frozen ground

You give me faith
When I'm broken down, I don't wanna run
I know we're safe
Even when the lights go out

What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it

Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded

Just need you in a blue bikini

Mom always said that books could take you to another world
But I don't think that this is what she meant

'Cause I've been...

Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

[Chorus]
Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way

And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

Disappear

[Verse 1]
I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that you'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back like a heart attack
That's always breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

But you were always the only
One who cast a spell and made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose you
So just do your trick and make it quick
Cause I'm pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Verse 1]
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Verse 2]
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

[Pre-Chorus]
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Bridge]
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

[Chorus / Outro]
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girlsRabbits hopping through the fields
Monkeys swinging from the trees
Lions are the king of the forest
But the scariest things alive...

It's dark outside
There s a moonlight
The dark scares me
But I won't believe
That you love me
Cause I know you don't
You re a filthy liar
Who likes Mickeyds
Who orders everything
Cheeseburger and select chicken
What are you talking about
Oh no one important
Ok
A1nyway
Let's say ohhhhhhh
Oh yeah
All night long
Up from top now
Now ohhhhhhhh
All night long
Alright
All night looooooooong

A little bit tired
What about we wrap this mother up
Wrapping it up, wrapping it up (wrapping it up, wrapping it and wrapping it up)

        Ever try to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream 
Every step that you take forward
It takes you right back where you been

And then when you least expect it
And you've tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinions
Somebody cares what you see

You woke me up
No longer tired
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fire

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat

You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

Oh trying to do it right
No rehearsals
It's your life
If you're doing this crazy dance
Cause your making these crazy plans

T's just this is not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take
On a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They're gonna know your name


When it gets old don't lose the light
You're cold, I'll warm you up
Your fire is hot enough, enough, enough

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Trying everything just to touch your dreams

You look so classic, fantastic
Oh when you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
You're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes

Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you make me new

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat

You look so classic, fantastic
When you on that floor
Bring the beat back once more

        Roses Is Coming  [Verse 1]
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

[Drop 1]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet 
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

[Verse 2]
You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet 
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

[Bridge]
I just want to know what we should have done
Want to figure out what we could have become
Because I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just want to go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

[Chorus]
(Whoa) Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet  (Oh)
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet 
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true[Intro]

Shake it up, shake it upWe had our moments. We had our fights. We had the nights were I slept on the coach while you slept in the kitchen. But worst of all, you've cheated multiple times and I'm faded. Now you see me gone. Now you see how tired I was of you
So don't be, coming back to me. After seeing how I am. Cause I hope you know my response
No, don't be running back to me. I don't wanna be, your lover. No, I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't wanna play your games[Verse 1]
Can you feel me when I think about you 
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wondering the desert for a thousand days
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

[Verse 2]
The stars are burning, I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling 
My heart is yearning, like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me 
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

[Bridge]
So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here
I can't explain, but day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa[Baby tell me that you want me,want me](pending)
Baby tell me that you need me
Because I'm onto you
Keep on the low I'll be waiting for you
Baby come on me show show what I can do
I can make all come true
Cause I'm onto you
Keep on the low I'll be waiting for

Oh
Were dancing in the red light
I can do it all night
Oh

We don't need a reason

Closer
Keep on moving closer,closer
Hiding in the shadows of the corner
Oh I'm falling over you
Oh I hope you know
I'll be waiting for you

Oh
Were dancing in the red light I can do it all night
Oh

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

[Chorus]
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

[Bridge]
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

[Chorus]
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find 
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life

I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find  (I was wrong, I was wrong)
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Verse 3: Maejor Ali]
Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it 
Or would you take it for granted 
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, "Te extra o"
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening 
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

[Outro: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decideWhenever you're around
Trouble calls my name
But I don t mind
As long as we conclude the day my way[Verse 1]
I know what I want and I know what I like
You're the one that I'm feeling tonight
You can take me here, here
Take me there, there
Take me wherever you like

[Pre-Chorus]
I act up when I'm up to no good
I got a big brain under this hood
After tonight, you'll discover
You can't tell a book by no cover

[Chorus]
I can bang

I've got my own mind
And I got my own hand
I'm a one girl motherfuckin' band
I can bang it here, here
Bang it there, there
It's bangin' wherever I am
You think you see me but I'm like Banksy
Turn up the bass on your speaker
If you really wanna learn
I can teach you

[Bridge]
Don't try to leave the dark
[ ] our bodies make a spark
Keep it going never stop
'Cause everywhere it's all the same
Just different places, different names
Just let me show you why you came, came, came, came
You came cuz I can bang
I can bang baby

[Post-Chorus]
I can bang
Ra-pa-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam (Like a drum, like a drum)

[Outro]
You can touch me baby, you can touch me baby
I can bang[Verse]
As I turn back and I look your way
I notice one thing that will never change
But I might find myself
Curious to a darker time
As I find my way to a new side
Puts all in space with a foreign mind
But I might find myself
Find myself[Verse 1]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it, yeah
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
But I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, you
To love, love, you
To love, you
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, you
To love, love, you
To love, you
I needed to lose you to love me

[Verse 2]
I gave my all and they all know it
You tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, you
To love, love, you
To love, you
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, it

I needed to lose you to love me, yeah

(To love, love, you
To love, love, you
To love, you)
And now the chapter is closed and done
(To love, love, you
To love, love, you
To love, you)
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly

        In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night (night)
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)[Verse 1]
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, go 'head now

        I know I m not there for you or there when you call
I m a bad girlfriend
I m a bad girlfriend[Intro]
(I'll come, I'll come back to you)
(I'll come, I'll come back to you)

[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Drop]
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hidin' 
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back, back, back

[Drop]
I know I'd...

[Bridge]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Drop]
I'd go back to you,  I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you,  I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you[Pre Chorus]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you

I ain't trying to mess your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, **** the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got **** up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the *** shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you 
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it

I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Good for you, good for you
Good for you, good for you

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, *** the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got **** up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the *** shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you 
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Good for you, good for you
Good for you, good for youTook you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding 
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use 
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again

I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind 
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

How does she touch you  can I try it, too 
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

        [Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin' 
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use 
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby[Letra de "NBA"]

[Intro]
Mau y Ricky
LaliHe said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what w  do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voic  is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (burnin'), it (it), down (down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow), you (you), around
(Follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]

You tried to change it all but i said hey, let s take it slow
There was something kept us to not make it together
We ended it all, you changed with another just for show
How do you want me to believe that you were lover 
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
 cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should ve ruled but you ruined my world
You cried to me like i was the one which crucified
Said you have changed baby, have you changed 
But you looked me in the eye even though you lied
I fell to my knees, without knowing that you revenged
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
 cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should ve ruled but you ruined my world
So many years spent but you replaced like it s wasted
Big love, big crush and it ended in the way i couldn t take
I start to wonder that if she tastes the way i tasted
Darling, i still got the same tiny heart that you still break
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
 cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should ve ruled but you ruined my world
So many years spent but you replaced like it s wasted
Big love, big crush and it ended with your one word
I start to wonder that if you still taste like you d tasted
Baby, we should ve ruled it but you ruined my world[Chorus]

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it

When you're ready come and get it
When you're ready come and get itIt doesn't hurt like before, no
                            !
The wound of your love healed
                      
[Chorus]
Once and for all
                 
I'm stronger alone
                         
It's just that I do not regret the past
                                 
I know that time by your side cut my wings
                                        
But now this chest is bulletproof
                          
[Verse]
I don't have you, I have myself
                            
It's not for you to think that this is for you, nah
                                          
I left so that you don't forget
                   
That a death like you is revived
                              
When the last sea dries up
                      
Is when I will think of returning
                                     
You have understood what I feel
                            
You are gone, how good is the time
       ,               
I'm cured of you, I told you already
                  ,                  
I don't feel you here anymore, I don't feel you anymore
                             ,                
You never knew, you didn't know how to value me, and (Oh)
                 ,                        
[Chorus]
Once and for all
                
I'm stronger alone
                        
It's just that I do not regret the past
                       
I know that the time by your side cut my wings (Ah-ah)
                                        
But now this chest is bulletproof
                          [first verse]
Your smile was the purest thing in our miry story
It shined like the sun and it lighted up my world
I have never thought that it could blind me
Or i would fall to my knees with your one word

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you d never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i d be falling
Now, i m dying in your eyes just to stay alive

[second verse]
We had just one life to live and spend together
But we couldn t make it, we couldn t even try
I always chase you down when you got farther
Baby, but it never ended in a way i didn t cry

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you d never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i d be falling
Now, i m dying in your eyes just to stay alive

[bridge]
Breathing under the water like i m drowning
I m going deeper down, i m going way too deeper
I m afraid if it could kill me but i m already losing
Ain t nothing else could kill me like you, like you

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you d never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i d be falling
Now, i m dying in your eyes just to stay alive
I m falling from your eyes just to be alive[Chorus]
