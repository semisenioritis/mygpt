English Translation

[Intro: Jungkook/V]
I'm a born singer just a bit late to confess ( I swear )
There's a mirage right here always far from me ( Yes, it's here )
I'm a born singer just a bit early to confess
Anyway I'm so happy I'm good

[Verse 1: Suga]
(Suga) The very first stage, named as BTS
Remind the mind three years ago I had
Still I was a hick but
I became a pro, no more amateur
When I'm on stage rapping and dancing which I wanted so badly
I feel alive although it's hard and tough
I can handle it cause you're supporting me
I can stand the pain cause I can hear shouting my name
I'm in a boundary between idol and rapper
Still my notes are full of rhymes
I write down the lyrics between on and off stage
Do I look something different I used to be 
Damn shit I am still who I am
Something changed  Go tell them
Nothing changed. I'm still a rapper man
I still rap and sing as 3 years ago. I'm out

[Refrain: Jungkook/Jin]
I'm a born singer just a bit late to confess ( I swear )
There's a mirage right here always far from me ( Yes, it's here )
I'm a born singer just a bit early to confess
Anyway I'm so happy I'm Good

[Verse 2: Rap Monster]
Frankly I was afraid to prove the big mouth I've told
How to surprise the world with something else. I dunno
Maybe I'll let you down
I was afraid of making my people down
But I straighten my shoulders and make my debut
The moment of silence, get my breath back
The people I've seen are now staring at me
Fancy TV stars are now below me
Uh it was a very fast time the only once play has started
It just took 3 minutes to show my 3 years
The fierce fought with mic
Though it's a few seconds, I put everything in. I'm fuckin' real
Hey you, what do you dream  Mine is a rapstar can't you feel
The shouts after the stage, yeah i could read your mind (uh yeah)
I could read your mind, no more questions, just smile
My team just tapped my shoulder
It seems like yesterday, but already past 20 days
And let, the haters on me, it's their job
When you play with the keyboard, I've made my career
Sunglasses, Hair style. know why you insult me
Anyway on 20 years old i'm better than you

[Refrain: V/Jimin]
I'm a born singer just a bit late to confess ( I swear )
There's a mirage right here always far from me ( Yes, it's here )
I'm a born singer just a bit early to confess
Anyway I'm so happy I'm Good

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
Remember the day we've been through
3 years, we were as one
That extremely hard days make me wet
After the stage drop the tears
Every single time swear not to forget the very first intention
Always like me, live up to me
So we go we go we go
More up, up, up

30 August YEAR 22

Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love  Can anyone predict the moment their love will end  What could be the reason that humans don t have the ability to recognize those moments  And why was I given the power to return all of those things 

The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought,  If only I could turn back time. 

Seokjin
12 July YEAR 20

Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.

 Hyung.  I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief.  Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave   Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered,  sure,  and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn t intentional. I hadn t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.

 Have a good vacation hyung! I ll call you.  Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.

Yoongi
15 June YEAR 22

I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn t know, and it wasn t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn t care. I just wanted to forget everything.

Jimin s voice was still ringing in my ears.  Hyung, Jungkook   My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.

Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down.  This is your fault. If it wasn t for you   It was my mother s voice- no my voice- no someone s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn t even remember the last time I had cried.

I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it  No, I didn t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don t want to hurt you either. I don t want to be hurt. So please, don t come any closer.

Yoongi
12 June YEAR 19

I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea.  Do we have money   At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills.  So we can t go.  The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.

 Let s go there.  It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok  I didn t care so I didn t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said  Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers."

 I didn t want to walk.  I heard Jungkook s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it  I had a strange feeling.  Park Jimin.  I called, but as I expected he didn t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.

 Hey, it s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum  Let s go to the beach.  I said as if dragging my feet. I didn t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin s expression was strange.  We don t even have money.  Hoseok replied.  That s why we re walking.  And Taehyung added,  If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.  Then Namjoons said,  Instead we ll just starve at dinner.  Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling  Flowering Arboretum  were gradually getting further away.

Namjoon
13 July YEAR 22

I rested my head against the bus window. From the library to the gas station, the scenery passed by the window, almost frighteningly familiar since I took this route everyday. Would there come a day I could leave this scenery behind  I felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring, nor to hope for anything.

There was a woman sitting in front of me, her hair tied with a yellow rubber band. Her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing. Then she rested her head against the window. For around a month already, we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop. We hadn t spoken a word to each other, but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs. The hair tie was still in my pant s pocket.

The woman always got off the bus three stops before I did. Every time I saw her leave, I wondered if she was going to distribute fliers. What kind of time was she spending, what kind of things was she enduring  How strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come, or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow  I thought things like that.

The woman s stop began to approach. Someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats. But in the midst of this, that woman didn t stir. She just stayed in her seat, her head against the window. It seemed like she was asleep. Should I go and wake her  I fought with myself for a moment. The bus approached the stop. The woman didn t move. People disembarked. The door closed and the bus started to move.

The woman didn t wake, even as we passed the next three stops. As I moved to the bus door I fought with myself again. It was clear that once I got off the bus, no one else would pay attention to her. She would wake up somewhere far from her stop, and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it.

I left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station. The bus took off and I didn t look back. I had left the hair tie on top of her bag, but that was it. That wasn t a beginning, and as such nor was it an end. It was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything. So I thought it really didn t matter.

Namjoon
17 December YEAR 21

The people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold. I looked down at the dirt, clutching the strap of my bag. I was trying to not make eye contact with anyone. It was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day. From a distance, I saw the first bus approaching.

I boarded the bus behind everyone else. I didn t look back. When I was passionate about something, when I barely had something in my grasp, when I had nothing left but things to escape- I had conditions. I wasn t to look back. The moment I looked back the efforts I d made until now became little more than seafoam. Looking back, that was a kind of suspicion, a kind of lingering attachment, and a kind of fear. Only when I had overcome these things could I finally escape.

The bus started off. I had no plans. I had nothing I was passionate about, nothing in my group, no particular reason to escape. It was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mother s tired face, my wandering sibling, my father s illness. Starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day, from my family, who enforced sacrifice and tranquility, and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned. But most of all it was closer to running from poverty.

If anyone asked if it s a crime to be poor, everyone would say it s not. But is that really the truth  Poverty gnaws on so many things. Things that were precious become meaningless. You give up things you can t give up. You grow suspicious and fearful and resigned.

The bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours. When I left from that place a year ago I had left no message behind. And now I was returning with no sign or warning. I tried to recall my friend s faces. I had cut off contact with all of them. What were they all doing these days  Would they be glad to see me  Would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then  There was frost on the windows and I couldn t see the scenery outside. On top of the frost, I slowly moved my finger.

 I have to survive. 

Hoseok
4 July YEAR 22

I stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid. Even though it was night, the hospital hallway was bustling with people. Moisture dripped from my hair, wet with sweat and rain. I dropped the bag I had taken off of her. A variety of things tumbled out of it. A few coins rolled away, and a ball pen and a towel. In the middle of it all was an airplane e-ticket. I picked it up and scanned it.

At that moment, the doctor called me. He said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about, and after a moment, she came out as well.  Are you okay   She said that her head just hurt a little, and she took her bag from me. Then she spotted the e-ticket peeking out, and looked up at my face. I shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go, pretending that it was nothing. As we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever. We stood side by side outside the door.

 Hoseok-ah  she said. It looked like she had something to say.  Wait a second. I ll get an umbrella.  I ran off thoughtlessly into the rain. There was a convenience store in the distance. I knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago. The plane ticket meant that she had made it. I didn t want to hear her say it. I didn t have the confidence to congratulate her.

Hoseok
23 July YEAR 10

When I counted to three, I heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination. The next moment the young me passed by holding someone s hand. I looked back quickly, but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me.  Hoseok-ah,  the teacher called my name. Only then did I realize where I was. It was a class field trip. I was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook. Five. Six. I kept counting, but as I did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty. The memory of that time kept surfacing.

I couldn t clearly remember my mother s face that day. I only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park.  Hoseok-ah. Count to ten and then open your eyes.  When I had finished counting and opened my eyes, my mother was gone. I waited and waited, but she never returned. I had only counted to nine. If I counted one more it would have been fine, but my voice wouldn t come out. My ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy. The teacher kept pointing, telling me to keep counting. My friends were staring at me. I couldn t remember my mother s face. It seemed like if I counted one more, my mother would really never come back for me.

Just like that, I collapsed to the ground.

By the time I returned to my senses, I had washed my arm so much that I was losing skin. My hands were trembling and I was short of breath. My eyes were bloodshot. What had just happened came back to me in fragments.

For a moment I had lost focus. I was dancing with a noona from the dance club, a collaborative dance, but I had lost my flow and we collided. I fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed. At that moment I had remembered what happened at the Flowering Arboretum. I thought that I had overcome it. But that wasn t the case. I had to run away. I had to wash it away. I had to look away. The me in the mirror was the same eight-year-old kid who had run away in the rain. Then all at once I realized. Noona had fallen down too.

There was nothing I could do. All I could do was fall and hurt someone, leave them behind, and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping. Every time I took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers. Car headlights passes me by. It wasn t okay. No it was okay. It didn t hurt. It wasn t that serious of an injury. I was really okay.

19 May YEAR 22

In the end, I had to go to the Flowering Arboretum. I had quit telling myself the lie that I didn t remember what happened there. I had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures. If I wanted to do that, I had to go to the place. With that intent, I went to the bus stop every day, but I couldn t ride the bus to the arboretum.

Yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after I d already let three buses go by. I asked what was up, and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do. Then he asked why I was sitting here like this. I thought about why I was sitting here like this. It was because I had no courage. I wanted to pretend I was okay now, that I knew a little, that I surpassed it on my own, but in truth I was afraid. I was afraid that I might encounter something that I might not withstand, that I might have another seizure.

Yoongi hyung looked relaxed. He slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him, and said that the weather was nice, said all kinds of useless things. After I heard that, I realized the weather really was nice. I had been so worried that I didn t bother looking at my surroundings. The sky was so blue. A warm breeze blew on occasion. From far off, the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming. The bus stopped and the door opened. The driver looked at me. On impulse I spoke,

 Hyung, do you want to come with me  

Taehyung

My side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing. Sweat fell in drops. In the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass- the girl was nowhere to be found. I had even run to the bus stop, but as expected I didn t see her. The people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely. What had happened  We hadn t promised to meet, but it was still strange. That girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around. Even if I told her it was annoying, it was no use. But now she was nowhere to be found, even in the places we used to go together.

I came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps. There was graffiti there we had drawn together. It was the first thing she had ever drawn. On top of it there was a large  X  drawn. It was her. I hadn t seen her do it, but I knew. Why  There was no response. Instead, several after images overlapped on the wall.

Her laughing at me after I had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head. Her helping me up after I d fallen trying to help her run away, her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window. Her gaze following the students we passed by, unbeknownst even to her. As we had sprayed this wall together I had said,  If you have a problem tell me about it, don t just grumble to yourself.  The  X  was drawn over all of those memories. It seemed like it was saying all of it was fake. I had made my hands into fists. Why  Of course there was no response. I kept walking. We were alone again. Me and her.

20 March YEAR 20

I slid down the hallway, my feet making noisy sounds. Then I stopped. I could see Namjoon standing in front of  our classroom . Our classroom. Nobody knew this, but I called that place our classroom. Me and the hyungs and Jungkook, it was ours. I caught my breath and approached. I was going to startle them.

 Principal!  I had barely taken five steps when I head an urgent voice through the open classroom window. It seemed like Seokjin hyung. I stopped walking. Was Seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now  In our classroom  Why  Then I heard my name and Yoongi hyung s and I saw Namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath. As if having sensed it, Seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door. There was a phone in Seokjin hyung s hand. His shock and confusion was plain on his face. I couldn t see Namjoon hyung s expression. I hid and watched. Seokjin hyung looked confused.  Hyung must have had a reason.  After he spoke, Namjoon hyung passed by Seokjin hyung and went into the classroom. I couldn t believe it. Seokjin hyung told the principal what Yoongi hyung and I had done for the last several days. He told everything, about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids. But Namjoon hyung said that was all okay.

 What are you doing here   I turned around in shock. It was Hoseok hyung and Jimin. Hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked, then slung his arm over my shoulders. In a moment of confusion, I let Hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom. Namjoon hyung and Seokjin hyung were talking, and they looked up. Seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up. He left the classroom. I looked at Namjoon hyung s expression. He had watched Seokjin hyung s retreating back, but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Namjoon hyung must have had a reason. Because hyung knew more than me, and was smarter and older. And because this was our classroom, I went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile. I thought that I wouldn t tell anyone else that I had overheard that conversation.

Jungkook
26 July YEAR 22

I sneakily broke a flower off the hospital s wreath. I kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it. The midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright. I knocked on the hospital room door, but there was no reply. I knocked again. No one was there. It was only full of a very quiet darkness.

I left the hospital room. I had met her here when I was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway. She had appeared so suddenly that I barely had time to stop, and there she stood, a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail. When I left the hospital I saw a bench. I remembered we had listened to music together and drawn, sitting there. I was still holding the wildflower in my hand, there was no one to give it to.

Jungkook
30 September YEAR 20

 Jeon Jungkook. You re not still going there, are you   I didn t answer. I just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes. When I didn t answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file. But even so, I didn t open my mouth. It was the classroom I used with the hyungs. After the day I had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom. There wasn t a single day I hadn t gone. Maybe the hyungs didn t know. Sometimes they didn t come because they had other plans or were busy with part-time jobs. I hadn t seen either Seokjin hyung or Yoongi hyung in a few days. But not me. I didn t skip a single day. There were days when nobody came at all. But that's okay. Even if it wasn t today, then they would come tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the day after. It was okay.

 You only learned bad things following them around.  He hit me again. I lifted my gaze and looked at him. He hit me again. The image came to me of Yoongi hyung hitting me. I gritted my teeth and endured. I didn t want to lie and say I hadn t been going.

Now I was standing again in front of that classroom. It seemed like the hyungs would be there if I opened the door. It seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why I was so late. Seokjin hyung and Namjoon hyung would be reading books, Yoongi hyung would be playing the piano, and Hoseok hyung and Jimin hyung would be dancing.

But when I opened the door, only Hoseok hyung was there. He was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom. I held the door handle and just stood there. Hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders. Then he led me outside.  Let s go.  The classroom door closed behind us. I suddenly realized: those days were gone and they would never return.[      We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal   ]

It smells like you
The road that I walk on
I plug my earphone to my status
My true feelings lie beyond there
Baby why you far away
I can t get used to you not being here
I feel like something is missing
I just want to be together with you always
When I realize we were only be able to meet inside this smartphone
You appeared before my eyes
Today too I feel the sadness of not able to see you
Contrary to my feelings time passes rapidly
Even if I feel insecure
I believe that my heart will not leave you
My heart will reach past beyond the wind
I am always under the same sky my baby
Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile
Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
 nside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always
We live far away from each other
Today too I feel lonely
I want to see you
The night that I am alone I unnecessarily feel the lonelier
With distance my heart opens more
It feels unbearable when I hear your rumor
I become more frustrated with more time passes
The amount that over flows always
Oh girl your smile still remains here
Even if we are apart my feelings are
Still the same, we are always together
Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile
Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
 nside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always
Even if we are far away
We are looking at the same sky
Even if something happens
If you are here I am not afraid anymore
I believe
Our love will lit for eternity
It will always stay beautiful as it is
It will always be like cherry blossom pedals
Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile
Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
 nside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever
Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

I said it's alright, oh yeah
One day it'll be a good day, for sure
You won't be alone, always
I'll be by your side, we'll be okay
(If) we're connected, surely it'll be brighter tomorrow
As you share happiness, it multiplies
But if you share sadness also, it multiplies too
So always laugh
And rest on my shoulder
We may argue sometimes, but we make up quickly
I understand your feelings too, well~ it's written on your face
Things like appearance, hmm hmm it's as if it doesn't matter
It has no relationship with our "relationship"
It's fine even if it's everyday
Showing off at this point, no thanks
Even without money, just seeing you is OK
So don't worry, let's laugh again
Yep bro, always the same
Yep bro, by your side
At anytime, we happy together
This unchanging feeling is the same as from back then
I said it's alright, oh yeah
One day it'll be a good day, for sure
You won't be alone, always
I'll be by your side, we'll be okay
(If) we're connected, surely it'll be brighter tomorrow
It's already been three years since we've started walking together
Between men, the idea of the "Oath of the Peach Garden"
We're pretty much family
Like the blood that flows through our bodies
Like "lifting" weight, I'll "lift" you up**
Laughing with friends until the end of our thoughts
Ma friend, don't be afraid
The swag amongst those who can hold on to their hope seriously
Ay
Hold up
Grab onto my hand
Let's fly! We in Gangnam
Now cheers! The Champagne that pops
You can depend on me
You can say "it's hard"
To me
You can lean on me, lay on me
Lean on me
So laugh, oh yeah
Tomorrow is a new day, that's why
The night is over, oh yeah
The light is shining in, just go your way
The space between dreams and reality
We keep walking till the end of life
Joy and even pain
If we share it 
I said it s alright, oh yeah
One day it ll be a good day, for sure
You won't be alone, always
I'll be by your side, we'll be okay
(If) we're connected, surely it'll be brighter tomorrow
I said it's alright, oh yeah
One day it'll be a good day, forever

30 August  YEAR 22
She seemed flustered as she stared at the diary she once believed she lost. Within every turned page were the movies she liked, the places she wanted to go, the flowers she preferred, and the future she hoped for. I had done this for her.  I m sorry,  never came easy for me. The diary acted as a starting and stopping spot for us.
I wanted to make her happy. I wanted to make her laugh. I wanted to be a good person. I thought that following the words from the diary would help me do so. But that s not how it worked. The more I tried to be someone else the more frightened I became. Wouldn t my real self be discovered  Wouldn t she be disappointed and leave me  Desperately, I hid and turned away from myself. But just like how a person can t end a sentence without it being complete, the me who I lost couldn t improve and instead wandered around the same places.

I know now that the me that is incapable and makes mistakes and fails is still a part of myself. No matter how terrible things become, only by being true to myself can I continue to move forward. I stood up and she didn t stop me.

I left onto the street and took my hat off. As I swept my hair back, all the hours I spent trying to mold myself into someone else slipped through my fingers. I lifted my head and looked at my reflection in the window. Staring back at me were pale lips, a frail face, thin shoulders. I looked wretched. I laughed. My reflection laughed too.

25 June YEAR 19

A lone flowerpot rested on the storage room s window. I didn t know where it came from. Which of my dongsaeng brought it  I took out my phone. The classroom was always dark with shadows since there wasn t any electricity, but I could still distinguish green leaves from the pale light coming from the windows. The photo I took on my phone didn t come out good, and it wasn t because I simply took it with a phone. I pondered this often - how a photo never captures what eyes can.

I noticed an  H  written below the flowerpot when I approached. When I lifted it up I read  Hoseok s flowerpot.  I laughed. Hoseok was the only dongsaeng who d bring a flowerpot here. I placed it back on the windowsill so only the  H  is visible again. I then looked around. I didn t notice this before, but the windowsill was covered with scattered writing. The walls and ceiling were covered in it too.  Pass or die,  the names of unrequited love, dates, and countless names that had become worn and illegible.

This classroom hadn t always been a storage room. Students used to filter it every day. It d be filled when school began and emptied during vacations. Were there students like us  Would they receive punishments for being late and missing class  Were there mercilessly violent teachers and never ending exams and coursework  Were there teachers who d tell principals about their students and their friends 

I wondered whether my father s name lied among the words. The school was my father s alma mater. He was someone who believed attending the same schools maintained a family s dignity. I read over the names and found my father s. It was in the middle of the left wall surrounded by other names. A quote was written underneath it,  Everything started here.

11 April YEAR 22

It was April 11th again when my eyes opened. Sunlight shined through the open curtain. I was overwhelmed with vertigo when I stood up. I had to close my eyes. When I did this, my surroundings morphed into a red afterimage, and I saw Taehyung. He was standing alone on top of the observation platform at the sea. That happened on May 22nd. It was the past and the future. It was something that d happened already and something that still had the chance to happen again. It was then that I thought everything had finally been fixed.
I watched Taehyung climb to the top of the platform as the sun began to set. The sky was still blue, but it was slowly blooming into red. I saw Taehyung climbing when I lifted my head. He reached the top after a few moments and looked down at us. Then he jumped. He leapt as if he had the wings of a bird, and for a few seconds it seemed as if he froze in the air. Something overcame me the way a mirror breaks, the way cold air blows in from an open window.

When my eyes opened again it was today, April 11th.

29 July YEAR 22
What was the reason that that particular melody became stuck in my head only after I lost the person I d practice it with  I glanced at the piano across the room as I reclined on the couch. When I was expelled I threw away the piano key that belonged to my mother - the only thing I'd salvaged from the ruins of my burned house. The piano key half burned itself. I threw it out of my apartment s window. I thought doing so would end it. I repeated to myself, like I had all those years ago, that I d never lay my hands on a piano again.

Early the next day, I hurried down the stairs unable to wait for the elevator. I thought I d fallen asleep abruptly, but the sun had risen already. The things I did the night before suddenly flooded my thoughts. The flowerbed outside the window was vacant. When I asked the security guard he told me that the garbage truck had already came, and that s how I lost my mother s piano key.

I continued to give up on music after that countless times. I won t do it. I won t come back. Music is nothing. But even when I ran away, I knew. I knew that I d return to music. The same why I d stumbled down that staircase, music was the kind of thing I d never be able to let go of. Internally, I was just as free as I was a person who was suffering. I was confused, but I was also lucid. Fear and confidence, hope and despair - I lived between those contrasting emotions.

Suddenly, I was overcome with the desire to play the piano. I wanted to recognize the me who had pretended to be strong despite the reality that I was a fearful coward. I wanted to pour the curses and make fractures and inflict wounds and hit and destroy and hold and cry. But I didn t want to run away. I wanted to finish the melody from the piano that frequented my mind every day. For once, it seemed like I could.
Yoongi
11 April YEAR 22

I kept walking with the acknowledgement that Jungkook was following me. Containers continued to appear when I reached the train tracks. It was the fourth container from the back. Hoseok mentioned having plans to meet Namjoon and Taehyung. He told me to join them. I said I would, but I didn t really plan to attend. I hated being attached to other people, and Hoseok knew that. He probably didn t expect I d stay true to my word.

When I pulled the door open, Hoseok stared at me shocked. When he saw Jungkook behind me an exaggerated expression of mixed emotion drew across his face. I pushed past both of them and strolled to the container.  How long has it been   I could hear Hoseok trying to pull Jungkook, who was shy, in.

Namjoon and Taehyung entered. A side of Taehyung s shirt was ripped. When questioned about it, Namjoon pretended to hit Taehyung with his knuckles.  This kid s late because he got caught by some cops doing graffiti and I had to go pick him up.  Taehyung made a melodramatic apologetic face and explained that his shirt had been ripped in the process of running away.
I sat in the corner and watched them. Namjoon gave Taehyung a new shirt to change into, and Hoseok pulled out hamburgers and beverages. In the midst of everything, Jungkook stood awkwardly. He stood as if he hadn t any idea what to do.  In retrospect, it s exactly how he acted in high school. Hoseok would noisily move around while Jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do.

How long had it been since we met like this  I couldn t remember. What happened to Seokjin hyung and Jimin  An uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind. This was the place I d visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else.

Yoongi
2 May YEAR 22
The sheet was immediately engulfed in flames. The pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat. I couldn't smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light. The only thing left was pain - the pain of the flames, the pain of my fingers blistering. It was only among the fire that my father s emotionless expression and the sound of music relented.

I was very different from my father. He didn t understand me and I didn t understand him. Could I have changed his mind if I tried  Probably not. All I could do for him was run and hide and defy. It occasionally occurred to me that it wasn t my father that I was escaping. But if it wasn t him, what was it  Fear settled in for a moment. What was I running from  What ends did I have to go to to be free  It all felt impossible.
It felt like I could hear someone calling, but I didn t look away from the dancing flames. I couldn t breathe. I don t know if it was the smoke or the pain. I didn t have the power to move anymore. Despite this, I knew it was Jungkook s voice that was calling. He must ve been upset and angry. Maybe he d feel bad for me. I just wanted to disappear. I wanted the smoke and heat, just everything, to end. Jungkook shouted something again, but I couldn t hear it. My gaze fell. When I looked up again I saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world. During what I thought would be my last moments, I saw red flames, endless smoke, and Jungkook s panicked face.
Namjoon
20 July YEAR 22

I lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements. A different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days. The heavy book, large bag, and paper cup were the same, but it wasn t her. I looked back down at the magazine. I was reading the same page over and over again for an hour. My eyes weren t processing the words at all. Why was I still here  I couldn t fabricate an answer. Among people who were absorbed in their own worlds, I was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine. I felt impatient, as if something was supposed to start, but I knew nothing would happen.
I brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves. They were taller than I was, filled to the brim with books. An open window breeze carried the library s scent in the air. I reminisced my highschool years. The books I read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent. Had the present me grown from the old me at all  I couldn t bring myself to be positive. It could ve been because everything seemed to be frozen back then. I moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book I studied from high school. I had to start over. I had to give everything up one at a time.

Namjoon
28 April YEAR 22

I knew something was going on with Taehyung for a long time. Although he pretended that nothing was wrong, his momentary anxieties gave it away. The fact that he didn t know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me. He was in and out of the police station. He had wounds all over his body. He had nightmares.
I never pressed on the issue because I was waiting for Taehyung to bring it up himself. The reason I never confronted him was also because I doubted my own to right to hear about it. I wanted to be a hyung, an adult. But in the end it all comes to the simple fact that I couldn t help my friends when they were struggling. They praised me for being all grown up, but I wasn t really an adult. Faced with problems, I could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me.

Yoongi hyung died - Taehyung had that nightmare again today. I had to shake him from his sleep. He sat in silence for a long time staring into space. He didn t wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things. He mumbled about Yoongi dying and Jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight. He said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday - that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real.  Hyung, don t go anywhere. 

Namjoon
11 April YEAR 22
I finished pumping gas. I begun returning to the shop. Something brushed against my face and fell. Stepping back, a crumbled bill settled at my feet. Out of reflex, I reached down. The random people in the car laughed, and I stopped reaching down. Seokjin hyung watched me from a distance. I couldn t raise my head. What are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others  You confront them. If you believe they re doing something unjust then you have to confront them. It s not a matter of pride or bravery or equality. It s something that you just have to do.

But I was a part-time worker at a gas station. If a customer threw trash I had to clean it up. If they cussed me out I had to listen. If they threw a bill at my feet I had to pick it up. My body shook with humiliation. I dug my fingernails into my palm.

At that moment, someone s hand reached down and picked up the bill. The car filled with people left as if the fun was over. I couldn t look up even after they were gone. I didn t have the courage to look Seokjin hyung in the eyes. It wasn't like he didn t know about my cowardliness, my poverty, my situation, but I still didn t want him to witness it. Hyung stood at the end of my gaze. He didn t move. He didn t approach. He didn t speak.
Hoseok
13 August YEAR 22

Jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio. The starting pose seemed endless. When the music flowed from the speaker, they begun the choreography I practiced with her not that long ago. I watched from my place on the floor.

When I first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing, it d been hard to swallow. It was stifling to simply watch other s dance. But overtime, as I taught and helped Jimin improve, I realized that not being able to dance wasn t that big of a deal. I could continue to be happy other ways.

I couldn t let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when I helped Jimin. When he made a movement smaller or more subdued, I d stop him and examine each movement individually. But when I returned to my place on the floor, almost like an audience for Jimin, I realized that Jimin s dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements. I viewed what I originally recognized as mistakes differently. The trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater, something unique. It was different than my own dancing, but Jimin had his own timing and his own expression. His dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own.

When the music ended, Jimin s dance did too. His face glowed with excitement and happiness. She stood next to him. She d be going overseas soon. We locked eyes. She didn t look like my mother at all because I couldn t remember my mother s face. So why did I see my mother in her  My heart began to ache, and the pain in my ankle intensified.
Hoseok
2 March YEAR 22

I liked being around people. When I was still at the orphanage I worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people. I d always laugh and be cheerful. I liked that job. With my experience of being exposed to more bad than good, it was evident that I had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful. Perhaps that s why I enjoyed the job so much. It gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy. What does it matter if it was usually forced  Overtime I could trick myself into believing that it was all real. My mood became better when I let myself laugh and by treating people kindly I became a kinder person. There were hard days, like always, and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming. But even so, it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because I had friends. Things aren t the same now.

Sometimes I remembered my friends when I looked at the store of customers. Seokjin hyung, who transferred in, Namjoon, who disappeared one day, Yoongi, who wouldn t answer calls anymore, Taehyung, whose whereabouts we weren t sure of, and Jimin, who never returned after he went to the emergency room. I d seen Jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times, but he never frequented the store anymore. Perhaps those times had passed.

I heard the sound of a customer entering. With a cheerful smile, I greeted them.

Hoseok
12 May YEAR 22

I opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase. My heart felt like it was going to explode. I swore I glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway. When I looked back, people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision. I pushed through the people and followed where I d seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit. Without rest and with an anxious heart, I ran down the stairs two at a time.

 Mom!  My mother ceased her walking. She turned around. I ran down another flight. Her face became visible. It was then that I lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward. I closed my eyes, but a person s hand reached out and held onto my arm. When I looked back at my savior, Jimin stared at me with a shocked expression. Before I could thank him, I turned my head.

There was a woman with a surprised face. A young boy stood next to her with wide, unblinking eyes. The woman wasn t my mother. I remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly.

I didn t remember how I got out of that situation. I didn t ask how Jimin had managed to catch my fall either. My mind couldn t focus on such trivial details. The woman wasn t my mother, and somewhere deep down I knew that from the start. It s been more than 10 years since she left me alone in that theme park. She d be older now. If I met her, I wouldn t recognize her by now. I could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago.
When I glanced behind me, Jimin was following me quietly. Back in highschool, Jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room. I thought about how he looked at me, unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital. Was Jimin trapped the same way I was, incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories  I took a step toward him.

 Jimin-ah. Let s get out of here. 

Jimin
28 July YEAR 22

I was stuck in the practice studio again. It was late and the train stopped running. To be honest, I had waited for it to stop so I could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections. I was restless. I was scared. But it was something I wanted to do, and so I stayed in that room overnight.
Overtime, my fear in my heart began to evaporate. Only the fun air of dancing persisted. For the longest time, I believed that the weak, small, powerfless me I imagined was real. When I danced I could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength. However, the me who danced wasn t small nor weak. My stuttering movements became more fluid and I improved. I grew the way fingernails do. Slowly. I realized that I was actually an expressive person. I felt this way when I danced, like I was saying everything I couldn t. When I started to dance I, for the first time, started to like myself.

Jimin
16 May YEAR 22

Hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley. It was very high. When I visited the one room apartment he d brag about how it was the highest room in the city. He bragged that he could see everything, every place, from his rooftop room. From the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers. Namjoon hyung lived in one of those. If I moved my gaze down a little I could see the school we all used to attend.
After locating the school, I drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city. A line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain. There was my - no - my parent s house. They were looking for me. When I ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted. I didn t have the confidence to face them. I couldn t go home yet. That didn t mean I wanted to return to the hospital, but I had nowhere to go and no money. Hyung had told me to follow him, and he lead me here - hyung s house.

I looked back to the apartment buildings. I had to return eventually. I had to tell my parents I wasn t going back to the hospital. I inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled. It felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure. I didn t trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital. I could be rushed there again. I was so afraid. I couldn t stand it.

Jimin
15 May YEAR 22

Hoseok hyung stood next to me when I opened my eyes. An all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness. I tried to sit up, but he put his finger up to his lips. Everyone was sleeping. The room was quiet. Hyung offered me a new shirt, and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital.

 We all came together.   He said that Namjoon hyung was keeping guard while Yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses. Jungkook and Taehyung would meet us at the elevator. Hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression. I was still in a daze.

I d dreamed of the day I d leave the hospital sometimes. I wanted to leave and see my friends so I could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before, but now I didn t know. Was it actually a good idea to leave  My parents hid me here and buried my existence. People whispered that I had a mental illness. I didn t know if Hoseok hyung viewed me the same way. Maybe he thought I was strange. Maybe I made him uncomfortable.

 Come on. We re running out of time.  The clock s second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyung s words. The sound of footsteps, like an auditory hallucination, came closer to the hospital room. Hyung and I looked toward the door and then at each other. He never let his hand leave me.

11 August YEAR 22

When I turned around, I discovered small letters written below the  X  that spelled out short sentences. One said  It isn t my fault.  It was her. I hadn t seen her myself and I didn t know her handwriting, but I knew. It seemed like a last goodbye, saying that it wasn t my fault she left, saying that this didn t happen because I was a bad person, saying that I shouldn t blame or torment myself, saying that I should be brave.

When I came to my senses I was back at my house. I could hear noona s scream from behind the door. I flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out. I moved to block noona from my father and I grabbed him. I looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised. But then he swung. It knocked me out for a second. This wasn t the first time that sort of thing happened. Noona s crying grew louder. My chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth. But I didn t stop. I grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled. He beat my shoulders and back relentlessly. I only held on tighter.

It wasn t that I didn t feel the pain. It wasn t that I wasn t scared. It was the understanding that if I let go, this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat. I wanted things to change.

No. I m not like my father. I m going to protect our family. Something he couldn t do.
Taehyung
1 May YEAR 22

 Hyung, is that all  You aren t hiding anything else from us   Our surroundings became quiet simultaneously. Everyone s eyes were on me. I looked at Seokjin hyung. He looked back at me. His eyes were full of exhaustion and pity. Somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before I could press the issue again. I didn t have to look to know it was Namjoon hyung.

 What does it have to do with you  You aren t my real brother.  I could feel Namjoon s stare. I shook off his hand without lifting my head. I knew that I was angry at him for no reason. I repeated the words I heard hyung use on the phone - that I was angry, that I was upset. His words weren t incorrect. I was a year younger than him. I wasn t his brother. It was true that I should take care of myself, but I was still upset. I was angrier than I could put into words. I hoped he d understand.

 Taehyung-ah I m sorry. Let s stop talking about this.  It was Seokjin hyung who said this. It was Seokjin hyung who called my name. It was Seokjin hyung who apologized. Namjoon hyung didn t do anything.  What do you mean stop  Since it s come up, why don t we talk about everything. You have something else you re hiding. 

 Let s talk outside.  Namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again. He dragged me out before I could shake him off.  Let me go. What right do you have to stop me  What do you know, hyung  You don t know anything. You just think he s this great guy, right   He let go of my arm after that. I stumbled at the release. No, it wasn t just him letting me go that made me stumble. When he released my arm, it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled. Perhaps I hoped he d never let go, that he d get angry and drag me out the way he did. Perhaps I hoped he d scold me like a real brother, like someone close and precious.
But hyung let go of my arm, and I could only laugh.  What s so special about being together  What are we to each other  We re all alone in the end.  That was the moment Seokjin hyung hit me.

29 March YEAR 22
The gas station worker spat on the ground when he left, and I sprawled my body on the ground again. I d been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station, and the owner hit me while asking what I thought I was doing drawing on someone s wall. I rolled on the ground. Getting beaten was something I was used to.

I started graffiti a long time ago when I found a discarded spray can someone left behind. I think it was yellow. I sprayed it around and stared at the paint. It was a bright yellow against the grey wall. For a while, I mindlessly painted like that, and I only stopped when I ran out of paint. I threw it away and stepped back to examine my work. I felt out of breath at the sight.
I didn t know what it meant. I didn t know what the designs and colors stood for or what I d done or why I did it. But I did it, and so I concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall. I d spewed my heart out, and at first I thought the drawing was ugly. For a moment, I wanted to erase it from the wall. However, instead of erasing it I caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs. I sat against it when I was done. It didn t matter whether I liked it or not. It didn t matter whether it was beautiful or not. It was me.

I coughed when I rose to my feet. When I hunched over and spat out blood, I saw someone s hand reach down to pick up the spray can. It was Namjoon hyung. I chuckled. I thought he was some sort of ghost. He reached out his hand, and I simply looked back up at him. Hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly. His hand was warm.

26 July YEAR 22
When I looked back, the hospital was a faraway place. I couldn t see the bench I left those wildflowers nor the window I looked out with her anymore. She was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital. We d sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set. I talked about playing in the hideout and vacations I took to the beach and walking to the train station. She told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof. There wasn t anything she didn t know about that hospital.
Her room was empty because she was discharged. Or did she move to a different hospital  I asked the nurses, but they said it was confidential. A corner of my soul felt empty. When I turned around and started walking I could see the school. It seemed that everything I ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs. Every story I told incorporated them in some way. For the lonelier part of me, the hyungs had become my friends, family, and teachers. My story was intertwined with theirs, and I only existed within them.
At some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them. One day I may go looking only to discover that they d be gone. Or maybe something else could happen. I didn t know.

I thought about that night, when the moon ascended in the sky, the world turned upside down, the headlamps inverted on themselves, the car passed me and then disappeared, the sound of the engine. It was familiar for some reason. I didn t want to jump to conclusions, but I still kept thinking about that moment.
Jungkook
28 May YEAR 19

 Hyungs. What do you dream about   The hyungs looked back at me in response to my question.  I have to write a paper about future hopes.  I elaborated. Seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said,  I don t think I have a dream. If I have something I hope for, it s just to the extent of  wanting to become a good person   He cut himself off, seeming embarrassed. Then Yoongi hyung, who was at the piano, spoke in an airy voice.  It s okay to not have a dream. I don t have one. I m just going to become whatever.  Everyone burst out at his words. They fit him well.

 I m going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guys.  Taehyung said this while standing on his chair to pose. He reached his arms toward the sky. Hoseok hyung scolded him telling him to get down before he got hurt. Hoseok hyung then added,  I want to find my mom and live happily. Being happy is my dream.  Hyung smiled as he spoke.  Does that mean you re unhappy now   Jimin asked. Hoseok hyung replied,  When I was in preschool I wanted to be president, but I didn t have anything I wanted to be after that. 

Only Namjoon hyung was left after that. After feeling everyone s eyes on him, he shrugged.  I want to say something nice, but I don t really have a dream either. I just wish my part-time job paid more.  I nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me. The paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents. What did I want to become  I couldn t think of anything to write.

11 April YEAR 22
I walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building. When I lifted my leg, my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below. The night of the city was spread out underneath my feet. Neon signs, honking horns, and dust was scattered around in the dark. For a moment I felt dizzy from vertigo. I stretched my arms out to balance myself. Then I thought about it. It would only take one wrong step. It d only take one step to end everything. I leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg. My breathing stopped when I leaned further. My mind was void of any thoughts. Nothing. No one. I didn t want to leave anything behind, but I couldn t remember anything. This was the end.

It was then that my phone began to ring. Clarity washed over me as if I d awoken from a dream. My subdued senses returned, and I pulled out my phone. It was Yoongi hyung.[      - 00:00 (Zero O'Clock)   ]

[Verse 1: RM, Jin]
"Nice kid complex"-that was my illness
(But I was still nice to everyone)
That was my excuse
Behind my back they were talking shit
In front of me they were acting nice
I pretended not to notice, school was a battleground
Perhaps this was my own battle in the ring called classroom
Someone would've brushed it off as something you shouldn't care about
Oh I don't care, but that's something only adults can do easily
Not perpetrators
Not victims
This is a place where we've turned into bystanders!
Even if you point your finger at me and call me coward
I'm fine with it, but how would you define it 
You know I can't lend you a hand
If I did that I'll end up the same as you
Don't be blinded by justice, the hero is dead
This is a reality, the only way to survive, there are no options

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience

[Verse 2: Suga]
The basis of a school violence
A vicious that can never end
There's no exit in this crowded ring called a classroom
That's right, in the end
School is like another mini society
A jungle made carelessly by adults
They made the weaklings weak, they made the strong powerful
Of course since they were strong
They made the weak suffer
A society
Built on the teachings that friends are only to pretend
The morals of adults made us step on the weaks to rise the top
Corporal punishment has been banned
In a moment of force
"I didn't know because I was out of it" became an excuse
That's right, this society is filled with bystanders
That are no different from perpetrators
The students trapped inside classrooms
Known as themselves are also victims

22 May YEAR 22
I thought my body was floating but it was actually the hard floor.
 I couldn't feel anything for a while. My body just felt unbearably heavy. I couldn't even open my eyelids. I couldn't swallow or breathe. My consciousness was scattering and everything was gradually getting dimmer
But then suddenly, my entire body started shaking as if it was shocked by something. I opened my eyes in the midst of the unknown pain and agony. 
A light faintly came into my view beyond my uncomfortable sight that felt like it was blocked by sand.
 It didn't move and just floated in the air. The figure became clear after staring at it for a long time. It was the moon
My head must've flipped back because the world was turned upside down. In that world, the moon was up upside down as well.
 I tried to cough for air but I couldn't move. And then a rush of cold air hit. I got scared. I tried moving my lips but no words came out. I didn't close my eyes but it started gradually getting dark. Someone spoke to me while I was slowly losing my consciousness

Translation[Verse 1: V]
Unable to win over my heart of sorrow
I endure yet another dark night of sleeplessness
Without a care about my despair
The morning heartlessly wakes me up

[Verse 2: V]
The scars hurt more than I expected
The pain goes deeper than I expected
The countless nights I spend resenting you
Are like hell to me

[Chorus: V]
Stay by my side, stay with me
Don t let go of my hand you hold
If you take one step away
I can just take one step closer

[Verse 3: V]
Thousands of times a day
My thoughts come back to you
All the cruel words you said to me
That icy look, those cold expressions

[Verse 4: V]
You were such a pretty person
You were such a pretty person
Please don t do this to me
You know me well

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
Oh girl
Those words you said lightly at the time
Made light our relationship in the end
I didn't know familiarity was the scariest thing
I didn't know your heart, until our end full of regrets
By the day, your empty spot grows bigger
Oh shit
Even if we water our flower bed that was once beautiful
Only our memories remain in full bloom
Only the scent of longing wafts out
If I can just see you again
I want to show you my everything
I'll hug you and hold you tight
So you can read my beating heart
For real, for real
Until this truth rests in your embrace

[Outro: V]
Just hug me, please hug me
Just run to me without a word
With a lonely and anxious heart
Like this I wait for you
I love you, I love you
I ll shout out from this long silence
My foolish and weak heart[      - Inner Child   ]

I followed my father into the principal's office. It had a damp smell. It had been 10 days since I returned from America, I heard that I had to start a year lower because the education system was different. "I am leaving him in your hands," my father said. When he put his hands on my shoulders I flinched without knowing.
"School in general is a dangerous place, we need order and control." The principal said this while staring dead into my eyes. Every time he spoke, the fat around his wrinkly cheeks and mouth would shake. The inside of his lips were dark red. "Don't you think so as well " I was hesitating at the abrupt question and my father squeezed my shoulders harder. The sensation caused shocks to go up and down the muscles of my neck. "I trust that you'll do well." The principal persistently continued to make eye contact and my father squeezed me tighter. He clenched his fists around my shoulders to the point that my bones felt like they would shatter. My body was shaking and dripping with cold sweat. "You have to tell me right now. Are you going to be a good student " The principal asked me this with a straight face.
"Yes." I squeezed out a response and the pain disappeared. I heard the laughter of my father and the principal. I couldn't raise my head. I could only see the brown shoes of my father and black shoes of the principal. I didn't know where the light was coming from but it twinkled. I was scared of the light.

I went to the sea alone. Through the camera lens, the sea stretched far and wide. It was so blue. The light reflecting off the water and the wind in the trees were familiar sights. If you asked me if anything had changed, I would've answered by saying that it was me who changed as a person. Pressing the camera button, the scenery in front of my eyes changed to the day from 2 years and 10 months ago. It disappeared just as quickly. That day we had sat by the beach shoulder-to-shoulder. We were exhausted. We had nothing and had no idea of what the future held. The only thing we knew was that we were at least together.

I stepped on the brakes after realizing I had unknowingly increased my speed while driving away from the intersection. The cars behind me honked in annoyance and passed me. It sounded like somebody cursed at me, but I couldn't hear due to the city noise. I saw a small flower shop in the right alley corner. I didn't make a sudden stop because I'd seen the flower shop, but rather it felt like I'd seen the flower shop after making a sudden stop.
The store was under construction and I didn't have high expectations when I approached the owner tidying up in corner of the flower shop. I'd already visited a couple of flower shops, but none of those florists knew of the existence of this flower. They showed me flowers that looked similar in color, but I wasn't looking for something similar. The flower had to be the real one. The shop owner stared at my face after hearing the name of the flower. The owner then said the flower shop had not officially opened yet, but said they could deliver. They asked me why I needed that specific flower.
As I steered the wheel and entered the road again, I pondered the inquiry. The reason why I needed this specific flower, I had only one reason, was because I wanted to make them happy. I wanted to see them happy. I wanted to be a good person.

25 June YEAR 20
I opened the door with a loud slam and took out the envelope from inside the last drawer of my desk. As I turned the envelope around a piano key fell to the floor with a sound. I threw the half burned piano key in the trash can and laid down on my bed. The emotions that were brought up hadn't simmered down yet. My breathing was a mess. My fingers suddenly covered with singe.
After the funeral ended there was a time when I returned to that house of ash left behind from the fire. When I entered my mother's room, the piano that was burnt to the point of nonrecognition caught my eye. I sank to the floor. I sat there as the sunlight shone through the window. In the midst of the last glimmers of sunlight a few keys rolled around. What kind of sound would I hear from the keys if I pressed on them  I thought about how many times my mother's fingers had touched them. From the pile of piano keys, I put one of them in my pocket and left the room.
It had been four years since then and the house was always quiet. The silence made people go crazy. After dad went to sleep at 10 p.m. everything became increasingly more quiet. It became suffocating. This was how everything functioned. I was tired because I had to live in such silence. I was tired because I had to follow a predetermined time-table. It wasn't simple to follow such a form. But what was significantly harder was living in that house, taking pocket money from Dad, eating dinner with him, listening to his scoldings. Whenever I had an argument with him, I always considered abandoning him and running away from home to live by myself. I never had the courage to actually do so.
I got up from bed and picked up the piano key from the dustbin under my study desk. I opened the window and the night breeze came in. The things that happened felt like a night breeze slapping me in the face. I used all of my strength to throw the piano key into the cold air. It had been 10 days since I last went to school. Even if I didn't want to, I assumed that I'd be kicked out. I didn't know if it was because of my deteriorated hearing, but I didn't hear the sound of the piano key dropping to the ground. No matter how hard I tried to imagine it, I didn't know what that piano key dropping to the ground sounded like. No matter how much time passed, that piano would not make a sound again. I told myself I would never play the piano again.

7 April YEAR 22
I stopped walking at the clumsy sound of a piano. The only sound in the empty construction site was the popping of a fire someone had lit in an oil drum. I knew the sound of the song that was playing. But why  My drunken footsteps stumbled. I closed my eyes and walked carelessly. As the heat of the fire grew, the piano sound, the night air, and my intoxication all grew fainter.
I opened my eyes at the sudden sound of a horn as a car grazed narrowly past me. In the confusion of the headlight's brightness, the wind of the car's passing, and my own drunkenness I stumbled helplessly. I heard the driver curse at me. As I came to a stop, prepared to curse right back, I suddenly realized I could no longer hear the sound of the piano. Amidst the sound of the blazing fire, the wind, and the silence left in the wake of the car, the piano sound was gone. It seemed to have stopped. Why had it stopped  Who was playing it 
The sparks from the fire surged forth from the drum barrel with a sharp noise. I looked at it for a long moment, spaced out. My face became hot with its warmth. It was at that moment I heard the clanging sound of a fist slamming down onto piano keys. On instinct I looked behind me. For a moment my blood rushed so rapidly that my breathing became erratic. The nightmares from when I was young. It was like a sound I'd heard there.
Suddenly I was running. Against my own will, I ran towards the music store. My body turned of its own volition to look behind. I felt somehow like that was something I had repeated countless times before. It was a sensation of having forgotten something important.
The music store had a broken window. Someone was sitting in front of the piano. Although many years had passed, I recognized them in an instant. The person was crying. Their hands curled into fists. I didn't want to be involved with someone else's life. I didn't want to comfort anyone else's loneliness. I didn't want to become a person who meant something to anyone. I had no confidence that I could protect them. I didn't have the confidence to be at their side until the end. I didn't want to hurt them. I didn't want to be hurt.
I walked slowly. I wanted to turn back and leave, but I approached them without realizing. A wrong note rang out of the piano. Jungkook lifted his head and looked at me. "Hyung."
It was our first time seeing each other since I quit high school.

8 June YEAR 22
I put on a new t-shirt. The me that I saw in the mirror didn't look like me. I was wearing a t-shirt that said  dream  on it, and in all aspects that just wasn't my style. I didn't like that it was red, the word dream, or the way it fit tightly against my body. I took out a cigarette in annoyance and looked for my lighter. It wasn't in the pocket of my jeans. I looked in my back pocket and realized that they took it. Without care they took it out of my hands and threw a lollipop and this t-shirt at me.
I ruffled my hair and stood up from my spot. I heard the sound of a message notification. When I saw the three letters on my phone screen, all of my surroundings around me became brighter and my heart dropped with a  koong . I broke the cigarette in half as I checked the message. The me in the mirror was smiling. I didn't know what was so great, but the me wearing a tight red colored t-shirt that had the word  dream  on it was smiling like a fool too.

Jimin's mother paced back and forth in the emergency room after checking that the name on the head of the bed and the IV drop were properly placed. She brushed a strand of grass from Jimin's shoulder with one finger. I approached hesitantly, feeling that I should tell her why Jimin was in the emergency room. I wondered whether or not to tell her about the seizure at the bus stop. Jimin's mother seemed to discover my presence, and she looked at me with a long evaluating gaze. I didn't know what to do so I stood still. Jimin's mother only said thank you and then turned back to him.
The next time Jimin's mother looked at me the doctor and nurses had started to move the bed. I moved to follow. Jimin's mother said thank you again and pushed at my shoulder. Rather than pushing, it would be more correct to say that she touched me slightly and then pulled her hand away. However, I suddenly felt an invisible line being drawn between Jimin's mother and myself. The line was sure and solid. It was cold and sturdy. It was a line that I could never surmount. I had lived at the orphanage for 10 years. I suddenly knew that something was wrong with my whole body, my sight, the air. In a moment of bewilderment I took a step back and fell to the floor. Jimin's mother looked vacantly down at me. Although she was a small, beautiful person, her shadow was large and cold. That shadow fell over me as I collapsed on the emergency room floor. When I lifted my head Jimin's bed had left the emergency room and could no longer be seen. After that day Jimin didn't come back to school.

25 February YEAR 21
I danced, not being able to take my eyes off of myself through the mirror. Everything became peaceful. Moving my body along with the music everything, apart from my feelings, was quiet.
The first time I danced I was 12 years old. I think it was for a talent show or retreat I went to. I stood on stage with all of my friends. The thing I remember the most from that day was the applause and the feeling of actually feeling like myself for the first time. Of course, back then I thought it was simply thrilling to move my body with the music. It was bliss, and I found out later on that that bliss wasn't coming from the applause but from within.
I was tied to a lot of things outside of the mirror. I couldn't stand having my feet touch the ground even if it was for a few seconds. Even if I hated it I smiled. Even when I was sad I smiled. I took pills that I didn't need and fainted no matter the location. That's why when I danced I tried not to look away from my reflection in the mirror. It was a time when I could be myself, fly and drop all of the heavy burdens. It was a time when I gained hope that I could become happy. I wast at peace with the idea of looking at myself during those times.

31 May YEAR 22
I looked away and felt my breathing stop all of a sudden. Although my breathing had been shaky due to dancing for a long time, it wasn't the same feeling. I thought about how I was like my mother. No, it wasn't a thought. It wasn't a form of recognition. It wasn't something I could explain. I couldn't even look at my friend who I've known for over 10 years now. We learned how to dance together, failed together, and even gained strength together. Because of how much we were sweating, there were times we laid down and threw towels at each other playing around. This feeling felt like something I had never been able to feel. I stood up from my spot. I leaned against the wall. I tried to calm down my breathing, but I heard  where are you going Hoseok  from somewhere. A voice, it could have been any voice. The voice called out  Hoseok . It could've been any voice yet it made me think about a 7 year old me from a time I couldn't even remember.

I went to the warehouse classroom that we claimed as our secret base. We always went there. I picked up a few chairs and I made my way in. I set the toppled-over table upright and patted off the dust on top of it with my palm. To humans, separation is always sentimental. Today was the last day of school and also two weeks until we'd move away. I didn't know if I would ever come back here or whether I would be able to see my hyungs and dongsaengs again. I folded the paper in half and placed it on the table. Although I held a pen in my hand, I didn't know what to write. Time passed by. After writing some meaningless words, the pencil lead broke with a sound.
"You must survive".
I unconsciously doodled those words onto the paper. Among all dark lead powder and doodling, I was suddenly reminded of poverty, parents, dongsaengs, moving, and other messy things.
I folded the paper into a ball, put it into my pocket and got up from my seat. Dust was everywhere again when I put the table back. As I got ready to leave I fogged up the window with my breath, and wrote 4 words. It was not enough at the moment, but it could be conveyed to everyone even if unsaid. "We will meet again." I hoped that this could be a promise between us.

11 April YEAR 22
I was digging through a shirt sale that didn't cost much when Taehyung reached from behind and took a shirt. It had the same phrases printed on it as my shirt. Taehyung smiled at me and took his ripped shirt off. Hoseok looked at me with shocked eyes. Taehyung wore my t-shirt and looked at himself through my dirty mirror. He laughed.
 I was late because he wanted to do graffiti and got caught by the police. I had to pull him out.  I pretended that I was getting angry at Taehyung, and Taehyung acted like he was really sorry. Yoongi, who was sitting in the corner of my trailer, walked towards us and hit Taehyung on the shoulder.

30 June YEAR 22
I looked a little strangely at myself in the mirror. As if my hand had its own control, I pressed the  open door  button. There were moments like this. Moments that felt like I had repeated countless times even though it was obviously the first time. The elevator door that was closing opened again and a bunch of people pushed in. A person that had their hair tied in a yellow rubber band caught my eye. I didn't press the  open  button knowing that the person would be there, but I thought that it was obvious that the person should be there. I moved back, one step at a time. As my back hit the cold wall I raised my head. The yellow rubber band caught my eye.
A person's back told a lot of stories. But I only understood a few of them. Some I had been able to faintly guess and some I couldn't understand. I suddenly came to the realization that you could only really know a person when reading everything just from their back. Were there people who could read who I was just by looking at my back  I raised my head and made eye contact with them through the mirror. They looked away. There were many moments like this. I raised my head again, but all I could see was my own face. I couldn't see my back.
Jimin
30 August YEAR 19
While Hoseok hyung was answering a call, I played around by stepping on hyung's shadow. Hoseok hyung bursted into laughter and said "Jimin has grown up". It took 2 hours to walk home from school. If you took the bus it was less than 30 minutes. It would be too little if you said it took 20 minutes. Hyung always lead me through shortcuts, alleys or even old bridges. We would stubbornly walk this route. It had been a year since I was discharged from the hospital and transferred schools. School was far from home and I didn't know anybody. I thought it was fine. I had transferred schools many times and who knew when I would be admitted to the hospital again. I thought that this would be nothing much.
At that time I met Hoseok hyung. It was just after the start of the new semester. Hyung approached me and stayed with me for 2 hours. I only found out a long time later that our homes weren't even in the same direction. I didn't ask why he stayed with me. I was hoping in my heart that the 2 hours under the sun could be lengthened.
After teasing Hyung during his call and stepping on his shadow I ran away. Hyung hung up the call and chased after me. Under the heat of the sun my ice cream melted. I heard the song of the cicadas. I found that I was suddenly scared. How long would these days last 
Jimin
28 September YEAR 20
I stopped counting a few days after I was hospitalized. Counting was something you'd do when you wanted to get out. Counting was something you'd do when you thought there was hope of getting out. The trees and leaves, far off outside of the window, still looked like a colorful painting. Due to this observation, I knew not that much time had passed. At most, a little more than a month could have passed. The medicine made everything boring and dull. Even so, today was a special day. The kind of day you'd have to write about in a diary. But I didn't have a diary. I didn't want to have any problems to write about anyway. Today I lied for the first time. I looked into the doctor's eyes and pretended to be gloomy. "I don't remember a thing."
Jimin
3 July YEAR 22
In the end I sprawled out on the floor. I turned off the music and all at once my surroundings were quiet. I heard nothing except the sound of my breathing and my own beating heart. I pulled out my phone and played the choreography video I learned previously that morning. In the video hyung's movements were smooth and accurate. That was the result of countless hours and sweat. It was the result of practice. Since I was nowhere near that I was incredibly jealous. Understanding and hoping were different. I was discontented often. I suddenly stood up again. I imitated the turn as he'd done it, but my steps kept getting tangled. I kept making mistakes at the part where we had to match our flow when moving positions. We had decided to try again tomorrow, but until then I wanted to show that I was serious. Rather than the playful praise of "that was better than I expected" I wanted to be recognized as a serious and equal partner, one who could match breaths with hyung.
Taehyung
29 December YEAR 10
I entered the living room after taking off my shoes and dropping my bag. Dad was inside. I didn't think of how long it had been since I last saw him or where he had been. I just ran into his embrace. I couldn't recall clearly what happened afterwards. Did I first smell the alcohol  Did I hear him curse at me  Or was I slapped by him  I didn't know what actually happened. He reeked of alcohol, his breathing was rough, and he had foul breath. His eyes were bloodshot and his beard was unkempt. Then he used his fist to hit me, asked me what I was looking at, and hit me again. He lifted me high into the air. Although his bloodshot eyes were scary, I couldn't bring myself to cry. I was too scared. That was not my dad. No, he was, but he didn't feel like it. I kicked my legs in the air. Suddenly my head hit the wall and I fell to the floor. I felt like my head was going to explode. My sight became blurry and gradually darkened. For awhile all I could hear in my mind was my dad's breathing.
Taehyung
22 May YEAR 22
I passed by the area of trees again where I received hyung's call. Recently that thing had continued to happen. I moved to a place where no one could hear me. I purposely slowed down my pace and hid myself near the sea. Hyung didn't see me and simply passed by. "Aren't you just one year older than me  Whatever. It's not something you have to be responsible for anyway. I'll take care of it."
There was something cold that climbed up my back only to disappear. Everything in my world seemed to have collapsed. It was as if I was struggling in the deep sea, making others feel cold and scared, tragic and lonely. I was angry. I felt that I couldn't tolerate it anymore. I wanted to stop everything. I wanted to hit him, but that smaller part of me was still scared. My Dad's blood inherently flew in my veins as well. His DNA was my DNA. Was there violence in me too  There was something that wanted to burst out of my tightly wound body.
Taehyung
25 June YEAR 22
I purposely slowed my footsteps and perked my ears up at the sound that someone walking behind me. Today was the third time we had met at the convenience store. If there was something that was different, it was that today they had run away as soon as they saw me. Then they hung around in a small vacant lot behind the store. As soon as I appeared they hid again. They hid themselves well, but their shadow was reaching far towards the front of the abandoned lot. I laughed. I passed by pretending not to see. They started to follow me.
I entered a narrow alley. This was the only place in our neighborhood where the streetlamps weren't broken. The alley was long and the streetlamp was located somewhere in the middle. When the source of light was ahead my shadow stretched behind. My shadow probably stretch all the way to the feet of the person who was following me with bated breath. As I passed beneath the streetlamp, my shadow disappeared beneath my feet. I started walking a little faster. Not long after a shadow that wasn't mine appeared on the cement road. I stopped my steps. The presence behind me stopped too. The two shadows of different heights stopped side by side.
I spoke. "I'm going to wait until you come here." The shadow jumped. It held still as if saying it wasn't there. "I can see everything " I pointed out the shadow. The sound of footsteps started to grow closer, purposefully noisy. I laughed.
Jungkook
25 June YEAR 20
I gently touched the piano keys with my fingertip. It left my finger smudged with dust. Even when using the slightest pressure of my finger to press down on the keys, the piano still let out a sound different from the ones hyung would play. Hyung hadn't been to school for ten days. Today I heard that he'd been expelled. Namjoon hyung and Hoseok hyung didn't say anything. I didn't say anything because I was scared to hear the answer. Two weeks ago, before the teacher had revealed our secret location, there was only me and hyung here. There was an open inspection that day. I didn't want to remain in class so I ran to that place. Hyung didn't look back, just played the piano as I laid on two joint desks to take a nap. In theory, hyung and the piano exist as two separate entities, but it was hard to view them apart. I didn't know why, but hearing hyung's playing made me want to cry.
When it felt as if the tears would soon fall I hastily turned onto my back. Just then, the door opened with an explosive bang. The piano music stopped. I was slapped so hard I fell to the ground. I huddled on the floor, listening to the barrage of angry words thrown at me. Eventually the sound stopped. I turned and saw that hyung had pushed the teacher back. He sheltered me with his whole body. Past hyung's shoulders, I could see the angry expression on the teacher's face.
I pressed the piano keys again trying to play a tune hyung used to play. Had hyung really been expelled  Will I ever see him again  Hyung said before that getting a beating was routine for him. If it wasn't for me, hyung wouldn't have hit the teacher. If it wasn't for me, hyung would still be here playing the piano.
Jungkook
11 April YEAR 22
I finally fulfilled my wish. When I saw the delinquents on the street I purposely bumped into them and got beaten up. I couldn't help but laugh as they beat me. My laughter lead them to call me crazy and hit me harder. I leaned against the shutters and looked at the dark sky. It was late at night. There was nothing to see in the sky. I saw grass that reminded me of how I felt- easily blown over by the wind. I felt the tears coming and purposefully made myself cry.
When I closed my eyes I saw an image of my stepfather clearing his throat. My stepbrother continuously kicking me while laughing. My stepfather's relatives would look elsewhere or talk about meaningless things. It was as if I didn't exist as if I was nothing. In front of them my mother stood helplessly. I started coughing from the dust. My chest hurt as if someone had taken a knife to it. I climbed up the roof of the construction site. The dark colors of the night seemed to overshadow the city. I walked on top of the railing, holding out both of my hands for balance. In that moment I nearly stumbled and fell. The brief moment reminded me that I could easily die if I just took one more step. Would death bring the end of anything  No one would be sad if I wasn't around.
Jungkook
16 July YEAR 22
I stood by the window with my headphones on humming softly to the song. It had been a week. I didn't have to look at the lyrics to sing along to the song anymore. I took the headphones off one ear to listen to my soft voice. Although I liked the beautiful lyrics they still made me shy. I scratched my head. The huge window let in the bright sunlight of July. The trees swayed gently in the wind. Every time the light shined on my face it felt different. I closed my eyes. Closing my eyes filtered out the light. I started singing again. I didn't know if it was because of the lyrics, or the song, or what, but it felt as if my heart had been painfully broken.[Chorus: Jungkook]

[Outro: RM]
Everyone's afraid of changes
Staying, moving on, staying, moving on
We keep repeating the same things again and again
I guess that's life, I'm afraid
Old or new, new or old, that isn't really important
What's important is, that we still breathe and live in the same place
So let's move onWhen you say that you love me
     
      
Oh just one more time
When you say that you love me
      
Say       
Just one more time
          
            
       something
And you can't make it nothing
        
You're my
    
        
    
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don't leave me
You got the best of me
         
        
         
         
     
              
I'll be you     
        
     take my hand right now
           
              
           
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
     
            
            
Thanks
    
        
    
You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don't leave me

The best of me

The story that we paint
I'll be wishing on a star so that it comes true
I'll continue to hope
Like tracing the stars
I'll wish again and again, I can't wait
Because I want to catch it
Wishing on a star
Woah, Star
This night in which I think of you
Woah, Star
It shines brightly
That's right, you're the best
As long as you have a dream, you don't have to worry
If you believe, it'll shine
The pearl of the future, right, right, alright
If you're tired, you can rest while continuing to move forward
So my baby, even if Pandora lies ahead, there's hope
So my baby, don't be scared, just be yourself, uh
If your heart continues to beat, uh
Don't change, continue to have big dreams
You'll shine again, baby
The story that we paint
I'll be wishing on a star so that it comes true
(Wherever you are)

Keep your dreaming hard
Just no matter where you are
I'm running with my heart
Keepin' my feet in the Mars and
No matter how it far
I'll be always restartin'
Even if I have to endure it, I'll continue to move forward
Even if all these tears dry out
Right, just being myself, just the way I am
If I can sing, nothing will ever be hard
The story that we paint
I'll be wishing on a star so that it comes true
I'll continue to hope
Like tracing the stars
I'll wish again and again, I can't wait
Because I want to catch it
Wishing on a star
I'm still on a journey right now
I wanna be close to your heart
It's a scene that I only saw in dreams
So just take me to where you are

Ur possibilities have no limit boy, there's no limit value
You can be a star, you can be a star, don't forget that
You will brightly light up what's ahead, like a star

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special

[Verse 1: Suga]
Our boss was indifferent, even three years ago
We ve never had the dinner outing that everyone else has
Outside, it s like a party
Us guys are bunched together as if we re in the army
This year I ll be either practicing or sitting alone in the corner
Nothing changes no matter how hard I try, I m solo
But boss, we don t want a solo victory
All we want is a dinner outing

[Verse 2: RM]
I can t stand it anymore because I m so lonely
It s the middle of December and my lips are chapped
I haven t matched up to anybody these days, I should give up
No girlfriend either because our debut is soon
Hah idols are getting married yet
Separating the male and female trainees  How does that make sense
We can t love so how do we write love song lyrics
If it were up to me, I d be encouraging dating

[Refrain: Jin, Jimin, V]
(They tell me to come) The company keeps telling me to practice
(This year, again) I spent my whole day practicing
(I m crying) I m still a trainee
I really want to debut next year

[Verse 3: RM]
Over here poop poop poop hey over there poop poop poop
This isn t snow, it s poop poop poop!
Look at the sky, it s raining white poop
God really has no manners at all, none at all
Even my forever alone friend Myungsoo is going to a solo victory party
I want to rest on that day and at least hold a snowman s hand
Our company, our boss - I don t like any of you
I miss my mom

[Verse 4: Jungkook]
My upcoming second Christmas, I don t even remember what I did last year
That s how boring and uneventful that day was
My name is Jeon Jungkook, my other name is maknae
Then I should be doing aegyo, as a 9th grader should
Boss, you re the one who is in charge of Big HIt
Manager, even the other official is at home, sleeping
(Oh my god!) I m going to cry if I can t play
If I can t, I ll kneel down in front of the company door

[Refrain: Jin, Jimin, V]
(They tell me to come) The company keeps telling me to practice

[Verse 5: Suga]
I entered Big Hit 3 years ago through Hit It
Making it through the obstacles, history in the making
We hold the Bangtan badge
But don t spit out rhymes and flow like our boss

[Verse 6: RM]
I m a bumpkin from Ilsan
Making it to the nation s top 1%
I got an unexpected call during my midterms
That was it, I became solo after picking up that call

But the very next day you gave it away

[Rap Monster]
Ah.. I m 20 now
Now that I m actually 20.. It s nothing special
So what am I supposed to do now 

[Chorus: Jin]
I m 20 (now) and it s a good day
I ve become a free body
But what is this, there s nothing to it I ve only become an adult
I ve only become an adult, I ve only become an adult
I ve only become an average adult, The average adult is what I ve become
An adult

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
Some have gone to whichever college, some have gone off to military service
Some are repeating a grade and some are looking for work
The tender touch of our families, that sweet romance has come at its end
Haste and clumsiness are all what s left
The weight of being 20, I thought would be like a feather
Now it s a boulder that pins me down, the regret at age 20
Oh no! All the Peter Pans who ve freshly jumped out of fairytale books
It must ve never existed from the start, this Neverland they dream about
A little sense of liberation, a little sense of regret (for an unfulfilled wish or goal)
A little sense of hostility towards this world that s strange to me
Because I m now an adult I want to keep a straight face and play it cool
Youth and naivete, they re both in vain, really
Eyah..Would you look at my lyrics, I ve matured
A friend who s been hired is lifting files (T/N:  seoryucheol ) instead of being in season (T/N: 'cheol , literal translation of colloquial phrase for 'growing up )
I was once a young adult but now I m an adult child
Mom s not around to take care of me, I m skipping meals

[Chorus: Jin]
I m 20 (now) and it s a good day
I ve become a free body
But what is this, there s nothing to it I ve only become an adult
I ve only become an adult, I ve only become an adult
I ve only become an average adult, The average adult is what I ve become
An adult

[Verse 2: Suga]
What every men in their 20s experience is a deep sense of remorse
Fearing military draft notes, the things that once felt so far away
Become reality. They said  [North and South Korea] would be unified by the time you ve grown up 
That s what mom said and I had completely believed her
But the reality is that [I m] an able-bodied first-rate soldier material
This friend who s perfectly healthy is a fourth-rate so why am I first-rate
How could I be so uselessly healthy
Civil duties  it s a juvenile death sentence
I envy and envy the nation s lowest 10%
It blows away this flowery adolescence, I m evading military service
The roaring 20s, time when everything is luscious
They try to set fire to flower-blossomed youth
The moment I graduated after the hellish exams
I attend another school, its name is Society
Applause for courage to malesin their 20s who were forced to break from Society
And a handshake of gratitude to the nation s 60,000 officers and men of the armed forces

[Outro]
Turned 20 and started attending a school, its name is Life
But there were no teachers there
Some will repeat a grade and some will be drafted
But do not forget this time of blissful ignorance
Adulthood, it s nothing, really
Adulthood, it s nothing, really
It s nothing like how it seems, really
Really, it s nothing like how it seems
Hangul

And put more than my hands in the air
Hands in the air, put your hands in the air
If you getting money, rubber bands in the air
Never gave an eff, they can cancel my care
'Cause if he look good, throw my pants in the air
I m here word to John Mayer
My body's a wonderland, my face is top tier
I swear watch the ice glare
They be like I m Gucci but don t shop there
One time, press rewind
Tryna come up off Nicki name press decline
So much power in the mind, yes divine
Take your change you ll never be next in line

  Nothing lasts forever
You only live once
So, live your life, not any other life
Take chances and never regret, never
Never be late to do what you wanna do right now
Because at one point of someday
Everything you did
Would be exactly what you will be

ENGLISH TRANSLATION
You are the sun that shines upon me
My soul blooms for you, my soul withers for you
I wish that you would hold me tight
Hold tight my unwithering heart
Even if I reach my hand out, my dream fades away
Even if I run, I'm still in the same place
There is no answer
Love is stupid, it's like playing a desperate game of tag
Just as we are
We start to run
Even if we get covered in scars
I can laugh as long as I'm with you
Run run run again
I can't stop
We run run run
It won't ever end
There's no other choice anyway
I can only love you anyway
Run run run again
Even if we're already hurt
We run run run
Even if we're still far
Even if we never reach it
Even if I'm hated by my fate
Run
Don't tell me bye bye
Run
You make me cry cry
Run
Love is a lie lie
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Don't tell me bye bye
Everything is over  It doesn't matter
I can't tell if it's sweat or tears anymore
In the midst of the headwind, the storm, and this love too
As long as I'm with you, naturally I can run again
Just as we are
We start to run
Even if we get covered in scars
I can laugh as long as I'm with you
Run run run again
I can't stop
We run run run
It won't ever end
There's no other choice anyway
I can only love you anyway
Run run run again
Even if we're already hurt
We run run run
Even if we're still far
Even if we never reach it
Even if fate hates me
My memories are like withered leaves
They turn to dust
A distant back, chase it again
Just back to where you are
As if chasing a butterfly, like being in a dream
Following your traces
Even if I already know, I can't stop anymore
No matter what
Run run run again
I can't stop
We run run run
It won't ever end
There's no other choice anyway
I can only love you anyway

3 August YEAR 22
I opened the door to the warehouse classroom and stepped inside. It was a midsummer night, and there was a mix of mold and dust in the unfiltered air. Flashbacks crossed my mind momentarily. I started remembering the principal s shining shoes, Namjoon s expression from outside of the door, the day I ignored Hoseok and left alone. I felt achingly sick revisiting these memories. I was overwhelmed by complex emotions fueled by pain. It s difficult to articulate, but these emotions weren t anger nor fear. The signal was clear to me. I had to get out of this place.
Taehyung seemed to understand my cognitations. He reached out to hold onto my arm.  Hyung, try a little harder. Remember the things that happened here.  I removed Taehyung s hand from me and turned away.
We had exhausted from walking for hours through the heat. Others had looked at me with a look of uncertainty, a look of not knowing what to say. Memories. What Taehyung had said about memories was meaningless: that I did that, that it happened to me. The stories of what we did together  It s possible that they actually happened. I do believe they happened. However, memories and remembering are difficult things to understand. You can t understand something by simply listening to it. Experience is something that s deeply rooted within your mind, body, and soul. I perceive these memories as bad things. I dream of being able to run away from them.
Taehyung and I fought when he tried to stop me from leaving. But we were both exhausted. We grew tired of hitting and yelling. It felt like fighting in a hot, viscous liquid. Taehyung and I tripped over each other. This happened suddenly. My shoulder hit a wall and I lost my balance.
I couldn t tell what happened at first. I couldn t open my eyes or breathe through the heavy dust. Coughs bursted out relentlessly.  Are you okay   someone asked. I realized I d fallen after hearing that person. The moment I tried to stand, I noticed the vacant crumbling walls. No one moved. I felt at a loss for words. Someone said,  We spent so much time here. We couldn t imagine a place beyond these walls. What is that   
As the dust settled, a cabinet in the vacant space came to our attention.
Namjoon opened it. I stood a footstep back. Namjoon picked a piece of paper up. My breathing ceased for a moment. The front of the page had an unexpected name on it. It was my father s name. When Namjoon tried to flip the page over I took it from his hands. Namjoon seemed surprised, but he didn t seem upset by my actions. I went through the bookshelf with trembling fingers and an old, crumbling note.
The notes were a compilation of my father s handwritten diary. He recorded his experiences with his friends in high school. Every day wasn t recorded. Sometimes he skipped a month. Blood stained some pages. I knew my father went through the same things I ve had to. I know he made the same mistake I made. He tried to run to make up for his wrongdoings.
He wrote about his failures. I know my father eventually gave up. He forgot, ignored, and avoided his miseries. He lost his friends. He gave up on them. The final entry had a date, but the rest of the page was ruined with black ink. It bled through to the following blank pages. The stains seemed to announce my father s failure.
I didn t know how much time passed. All my senses were dullened. I felt a chilled breeze from the window. The darkest part of the day, the time before the sun rise, had arrived. My dongsaengs, including Namjoon, were sleeping. I looked up toward the ceiling. I remember seeing my dad s name etched up there. When I catch sight of his name, I notice a sentence written below:  Everything started here. 
I felt something from my fingertips when I was about to close the diary. On top of the many words, in the spaces between the lines, were the things my father decided to forget. The color faded away, but the traces of how the pen was pressed against the paper remained. My father s times of fear, hopelessness, and despair swirled around the pages. My father s twisted map of soul was reflected within the diary.
When I closed the dairy I began to tear up. I looked at each of my friends. Maybe this was us coming back. Everything started here. I realized the meaning of being together and being able to laugh and feel joy together. My first mistake, the mistake that I ve never been able to confess, felt like a scar.
I thought these things couldn t be a coincidence. Eventually, I had to come here. I had to come here and realize my faults. I had to come back here and seek what was behind the pain and agony. 
I had to come back here and, for the first time, take a step closer to finding a map to my own soul.English Translation

[Intro]
Wake up, Wake up
Wake up, Wake up

[Verse 1: RM]
The morning that wraps my thousand emotions
I think the best would be if everything ends
At that time, when I almost went to the wrong path
I heard my parents voices saying "Wake up already!"
Aight mom, I'll stand up now
My fam, my friends and also my fans
For you who are like a dream, more than my own dream
I won't sleep anymore
I have to make my face and body keep going to work
My pen is a sword, my whole body is a pistol
And all my haters, if you tried living you'll also feel tired
But I gotta kill ya'll for the sake of living myself I gotta beat ya'll
Lately, I understand my parent's feelings
These feelings seem like they're going to overflow in my mind
No matter how tired or sleepy I am
The morning that won't change, just keep on and on and
Just keep on and on and
Just keep on and on and
Just keep on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Wake up Look, open your eyes
Wake up Everyone is waiting for you
Wake up There's no time
Wake up So we're gonna run hard

[Hook: Jungkook, RM]
Gotta live my life, gotta take my pride
Gotta shine my light
Wake up, wake up
Gotta live my life, gotta take my pride
Gotta shine my light
Wake up, wake up

[Verse 2: Suga]
The clock points to 6 o clock
When everyone wakes up I go to bed
My face is reflected on the mirror
I know, I'm tired
It's not someone's fault, I'm doing it to myself
Even the music that I like turn into a battlefield
Shit! There's no other way, but to do it crazily!
I'll keep going forward on my destiny
I start a bit later than everyone else
A day, a feeling of hoping to play is postponed
Today is crucial for my dream
I don't care about the things ahead
22 years old, nothing more
I feel the difference from my surroundings, it's like an hypnosis
I sleep like I was drunk, but I wake up
I change into my tired face, today's life
I chase the reality but I'm a Dream Chaser
I might be lethargic, so if I wear my costume, I turn again
On the stage, the moment when I'm on it I wake up
That's the meaning of my life, with this step up!

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Wake up Look, open your eyes
Wake up Everyone is waiting for you
Wake up There's no time
Wake up So we're gonna run hard

[Hook: Jungkook, RM]
Gotta live my life, gotta take my pride
Gotta shine my light
Wake up, wake up
Gotta live my life, gotta take my pride
Gotta shine my light
Wake up, wake up

[Verse 3: JHope]
Wake up day, climb up
Today's plan is to be have a surprising day
Going downwards with the body and mind
But when did I put on my costume 
Go make up, no break up
The makeup which hides my tired face
We go on the stage like pros, we the player
We get showered by everyone's cheers, I'm enchanted!
If it is Mike who dribbling a burning ball instead of the normal Ball
So exciting if no one can't stop my shoot
Even my sweat drops fall to the rhythm
Water and oil, just like myself in the morning
I'm ill, I'm real
The time is passing by, but the thrill
I keep on living on the day that I feel like I understand, but I don't
But I can't stop, let's go still aye
I can't rest at all so I'll fly
I can't surpass it, my polished sneakers
Shine with the light woah

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
Wake up Look, open your eyes
Wake up Everyone is waiting for you
Wake up There's no time
Wake up So we're gonna run hard

Wake up hi, nobotte
Odoroku ry  ky  no yotei
Shinshin tomo ni m  kak  sen
But itsunomanika ish  matotte
Go make up, no break up
Tsukare sae kakushi te shimau kono makeup
Puro rashiku butai ni agaru we the player
Abiru minna no kansei mata miseru!
Maiku nara ball kawarimoyasu doriburu
Dare mo tomerare nai sh to o sure ba issh 
Ase no shizuku ochiru oto made rizumu
Mizu to abura sa marude asagata no jibun
I'm ill, I'm real
Jikan wa sugi te iku kedo thrill
Wakaru y  de wakara nai hi ikiru
De mo tomara nai sa iku ze still aye
D se yasume nai nara ba isso habataku
Koerare nai sa dare mo migaku sun k 
Hikari de kagayaku woah

Where are you  Let s meet again
Let s say a meeting place for example
Let s go eat together again, I ll invite you
But it doesn t have any particular meaning
Your friends click the  like  button
But before that I can see that you look good
When I saw that you changed your profile states to  single 
Let s just meet soon again
The awkwardness surrounds us
You were different before, in order to cover up
For your (former) coolness, I casually talk to make the conversation bloom
I remember the past again
Our relationship becomes  EX 
Between us OH NO! Becomes  X 
When did a wall form between us  Two people who pass by without noticing each other

At that place, again with you
At that place, if we can meet
At that place, I ll be waiting
I want you to come GIRL

Don t know, looking like you don t know
A GIRL who seems fun
I m still crazy about you, you re still CUTE
You re still dazzling girl
Don t know, looking like you don t know
A GIRL who seems fun
A GIRL who shines

Today too memories pass through the LAN cable
The memories draw me back, your hair from behind
I m always looking at the blue screen, I start to hate it
Every time I feel like clicking the  like  button I try calling you
Hello 
I wish that you remember me, If you could maybe 
It s ok, I say that I want to meet you soon
Tell me if you want to meet me or not
It s simple, I want to feel relieved so I m over-optimistic
If we can meet I want it to feel like a goukon
Your words break the silence
 I got a boyfriend , that place starts freezing
Of course you changed
Even that expression of yours is different
The burning love flows like water
The spring is far, the winter days flow again 

At that place, again with you
At that place, if we can meet
At that place, I ll be waiting
I want you to come GIRL

Don t know, looking like you don t know
A GIRL who seems fun
I m still crazy about you, you re still CUTE
You re still dazzling girl
Don t know, looking like you don t know
A GIRL who seems fun
A GIRL who shines

How were you lately 
I peeked and the  like  shined
You cutie
Even being happy when you re alone now 
HEY Remember now
From that time the time difference has increased
Even if I try repeating it the theory won t change
Even so I still click the  like  button 

At that place, again with you
At that place, if we can meet
At that place, I ll be waiting
I want you to come GIRL

[KM-MARKIT] Thank you ladies and gentlemen
It's your man K to the M baby
And I'd like to introduce my boys tonight
You know how we do. We're hitting big yo!
(That's right, let's go!)

No matter how much I run, like a running machine
The scenery of this city won't change
No matter how serious I become, as I become serious
The gear/cog wheel rewinds and rushes
BUT, EVER NEVER GIVE UP the life is a big seesaw
There are up and downs, even in the natural world
Your hands are going to be chained one day
There is glory sometimes, but it also gets closed
CAN YOU FEEL THIS LIFE  If so, don't give up
Let's aim for the shinning tomorrow for our dreams
Even if there are times when you feel discouraged, it's not meaningless
Even if you're in the last place now, if you have a dream you're not
So NEVER GIVE UP, don't think too much about it
Just by looking at it you won't archive the big show
With your heart, little by little, along with your dream, the upcoming future's success
Until that time don't stop and LET IT GO again!

No matter when, yes!
No matter what happens
If you look up
UH, the shining stars

SO, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
Just like that shining star
Light up as if you're going to disappear

ALL NIGHT LONG
The overlapping MOON LIGHT
The throbbing GOOD NIGHT
ALL NIGHT LONG

ALL NIGHT LONG
The overlapping MOON LIGHT
The throbbing GOOD NIGHT
ALL NIGHT LONG
HOLD UP! The surges to give up
That life is more valuable than you think
Let's start with small steps
Even so, why is the thorny road wrong  HUH
There are unpleasant things sometimes
BUT if we're together, it's like a harmony surrounds us
Our warm hands together, hugging our
Chest and hopes, all the way to our hearts
Understanding each other THAT'S RIGHT We'll change to a super positive MIND
So don't worry (NO WAIT)
LIFE'S A GAME Time to enjoy (GO PLAY)
WE RIDE (GO WAY) WE RIGHT (OKAY)
Escaping my future (GO STRAIGHT)
Now, the volition bullets that hit my heart
Are oriented to the world POWPOW  LIKE A SHOT GUN 

SO, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
Just like that shining star
Light up as if you're going to disappear

ALL NIGHT LONG
The overlapping MOON LIGHT
The throbbing GOOD NIGHT
ALL NIGHT LONG

WE WANNA GET MONEY, WE WANNA GET THE FAME
WE WANNA GET EVERYTHING, BUT WE STILL FEEL THE SAME
Where is the happiness headed 
It unexpectedly doesn't go anywhere
A day ends in your mind, inside the building
That's the only thing money can't buy
The dreams are free size, aim to the vast skies
In your chest yes! The big milky way ON THE FLOW!

SO, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT
Just like that shining star
Light up as if you're going to disappear

ALL NIGHT LONG
The overlapping MOON LIGHT
The throbbing GOOD NIGHT
ALL NIGHT LONG

ALL NIGHT LONG
The overlapping MOON LIGHT
The throbbing GOOD NIGHT
ALL NIGHT LONG

13 June YEAR 22
After returning from the sea we were all alone.
We didn't keep in touch as if we had specifically planned not to. We merely assumed our existence by the graffiti left on the street, the brightly lit petrol station, and the piano sound from the old building. This was when the after image of that night came alive like a vision. Taehyung's eyes looked as if they breathed fire, the way his eyes watched me as if he had heard something unbelievable. Namjoon's hand tried to stop him, and I, who couldn't suppress it, threw a punch at Taehyung.
Failing to find Taehyung, who ran out, I returned to the dorm near the beach. No one was there. Only a broken glass cup, blood stains, which began to dry up, and cookie crumbs brought me back to what had happened a few hours ago. There was a photo lying in the midst of this. In the photo we stood together smiling while we posed with the sea as our background.
I continued to walk past the front of the petrol station. The day when we would meet again would come. Someday we'd smile together just like in the photo. The day when I had the courage to face myself entirely would come. However, right then, that very moment was not the right time. The damp wind blew similar to how it did that day. My phone began to ring as if in warning. The photos I hung on the room mirror began to shake. I saw Hoseok's name on the screen.
"Hyung, Jungkook had a car accident that night."[Chorus: V, Jungkook, Jimin]

[Intro: Rap Monster]
This is an emotion between a man and a woman
Don't wanna calculate it, it don't wanna regulate it
If I knew that true love was like this
I can't be sure if I'd have tried it
All I feel is anger, and the danger

In this album that we are releasing at the start of
the New Year, I want to ask that you take care of
us this year as well.
First, my family. I miss you and want to take care
of you from beside you, but I'm sorry that I can't do
that. My family who I love, please don t ever forget
that I love you. Thank you, always.
Our members, Namjoonie 
hyung
. Seokjinie 
hyung
,
Hoseokie 
hyung
, Yoongi 
hyung
, Taehyungie, Jeonggukie. Thinking about it, we re already about
to enter our 5th year (since debut). I always feel this, but I think I can be strong just from looking at
you guys who are always beside me. We used to not match/mix well, but now I often think that we re like real brothers. I want to express my gratitude to all of you who make all the work that I do feel more enjoyable. I love you.

A.R.M.Y.
We're already approaching the start of our 5th
year (since debut). Time goes by so~ fast, doesn t
it. I also wonder when time flew by so quickly.
Don t worry. There s still so much we have to show
you, so starting with this album, I think we ll spend this year together. Let's start this album and spend
this year pleasantly. Have a happy new year. don t
get sick, and I hope everyone can be happy. I love
you!
I love all of you who are always with us.
Sincerely, Jimin.

[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, just one day, one night
That's all I've ever want girl

[Verse 1:]
Just one day if there was time
I want to sleep soundly in your sweet scent
A chance between a tight schedule
I want to be reflected in your gentle eyes
I like that, that glossy hair
Pinning up her hair seems so precious. She's awesome like god
Wherever we go the two of go a hand will be around each waist
Yo my honey every time I see you my feelings seize up
The sound of you taking a breath is like bgm
I fly through the air when you call me with your voice
Not interested in other things anymore, I want to dance to your mood
I'm a thrill seeker so looking for you, hold me tight
Girl I want to keep looking at you
Because you are so bright
I keep thinking of the world of us till morning
Because it's already a far distant dream for me

[Chorus:]
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day
If I can hold hands with you
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day (just one day)
If I can be together with you
(do it, do it, do it)
Please let's always meet, meet!
(do it, do it, do it)
You & me together party, party!
(do it, do it, do it)
Please let's always meet, meet!
(do it, do it, do it)
You & me together party, party!

[Verse 2:]
If my wish does come true
I want to go out with you
Even watching just one movie
Even though it can't become fully open [relationship/feelings/mind] girl
I'm sorry I was thinking too much
Please show me that smile again
Just a little bit of uplifting
I always seem to get hurt due to chasing my dream
Just give me one day I just want one day
Blaming work trapped in a relationship
As only one can say
A story of a morning glory bloomed and fell
How do I try to forget you
I might look cool when speaking to you
And say to myself even now and for you [it's for the best]
I hope for happiness

[Chorus:]
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day
If I can hold hands with you
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day (just one day)
Girl, you & me just the two of us let's go, aight!

[verse 3:]
24 hours we are alone
Boast about our relationship in the morning sun with a kiss
Brunch outside feels good
Holding hands, soaking in the sunlight
Dance with me on the night shooting stars will fall
Moonlight is the candle for the two of us
One day as I wanted
Will surely come, just you & me

[Chorus:]
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day
If I can hold hands with you
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day (just one day)
If I can be together with you
(do it, do it, do it)
Please let's always meet, meet!
(do it, do it, do it)
You & me together party, party!
(do it, do it, do it)
Please let's always meet, meet!
(do it, do it, do it)
You & me together party, party!

[Outro:]
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day
If I can hold hands with you
Just one day
If I can be together with you
Just one day (just one day)
If I can be together with you
Can you please stay with me [Lyrics: V, Jungkook, Jin]

The curtains are going down now here
This memorable mind
How was I today 
Did everyone get pleased 
Even so, I do it like this
Being able to please people
Happy feeling remaining after finish
Now, on the stage where no one is present

On the stage where there is no one
Loneliness has come
Complex feeling
Restraining prayers
I will overcome it all the time
I knew I was used to it
I can't hide this feeling
As a cold one alone
Also after this stage

Anxious later
While saying that there is no perfection
Lower the burden
Because this cheer is not forever
Still want to stay together
That voice
Even if it is not eternal (sore), I sing again
It won't change as it's now
As a boy in eternity
Ahh

Forever
We are young
In the dancing flower petals
Wandering (Wandering) even now

Forever
We are young
Even if it gets scratched
Toward aiming dream come true

Forever, ever, ever, ever
Dream, hope, advance, advance
Forever, ever, ever

Manager hyungs whom we interact with the most, you have worked the hardest. Thank you for treating us as artists, and we will not only treat you comfortably because we re close, but will also try harder to respect you guys, as a hyung, dongsaeng and a human being.

To VC Team who always upgrade us more, who work the hardest for every new concept, countless outfits, themes and visuals, and especially whenever there s a filming. Thank you for lessening our worries and making us look good. Please sleep a lot when you have free time   

I send my sincere thanks to Director Lumpens and our dear hair stylists & make-up artists.

To Communication Team who do so much behind the camera, I can t even imagine all the hard work you do. Thank you for being our eyes, ears and mouths, and we will work hard so as not to forget that our attitude and mindset are still the most important.

To Director Lee Hyuk and all the staff at the Japan office, you must be tired from me bothering you with questions about Japanese all the time, but thank you for always kindly teaching me. I ll try to be better at Japanese and be a help to the team.

To Trainee Development Team who are focusing on training many great junior singers, though we don t interact much with each other now! If there s something I can help with, I definitely will, even if it s just with my heart.

To the members, other than saying I love you  Thank you for listening and taking in my words.

ARMY!! I always get emotional whenever I think of you guys. I hope you ll like the music and lyrics from this album, and hope it can be of help in your lives. Because that s the motive of this album. Also I d like to say I truly love you all the international ARMYs. Hope you know it. Always.

Thank you.

To Bighit staff, including Bang Shihyuk PD-nim.
There are so many more staff now that I don t know all of you.
But still, those who came with us since we first started, needless to say, I know that you re always working hard and doing so much for us in the back without getting to sleep, and even those whom I don t know are working hard for us in the back as well. You always take care of so many things for us that I don t know where I should start from or how I should thank you. Thank you for creating us and creating every opportunities we get. As much as you have worked hard for us, we will rise higher. Please keep an eye on us.

Our manager hyungs.
You must have had a hard time right  You can t even tell us and always work so hard. You have it tougher than us and sleep less than us, but even though I know that, I feel like I should know more, I m sorry. Anyway, I m always grateful to our hyungs. I wouldn t be able to understand everything but I understand that you ve had it tough and I want to tell you to cheer up. Thank you.

To our staff who always stay by our side.
Now that there are staff younger than me, I can t refer to everyone as hyungs and noonas anymore. But for real, we re together 340 days out of 365 days a year. Thank you. Even though you re always with us, I have never seen you guys saying that it s tiring. I m sorry that we always whine but we can t do more for you compared to the amount of time you stay with us. Thank you to all the make-up artists and hair stylists for always making us look beautiful and caring about us. Let s keep working together in the future as well.

To Director Lumpens and Director Nam Hyunwoo who always create wonderful works for us and go through a lot to do so.
It s actually not an overstatement to say that most parts of us are made by you guys. I m always grateful. Counting on you guys to make us come out great in the future as well. Thank you. And to Chief Heejun and Photographer Mugunghwasonyeo whom we just worked with for the first time, thank you for taking beautiful photos. They are so beautiful that I d love to work with you again if there s a chance. Thank you for your hard work.

To our family.
Our family who just silently stay by side and become my source of strength, always be healthy and don t get hurt.
Thank you.

To our members.
I had this thought often,  they really care a lot about me .
Thank you so much. Sincerely. Let everything we want to do come true in the future as well.

To Taeminie-hyung, Moonkyu-hyung, Kwonho-hyung, Jonginie-hyung, Sungwoonie-hyung.
Thank you, really. Thanks to you guys I m having fun everyday     

To our ARMYs.
I don t want to make you guys wait, but I always end up leaving you waiting. I heard that you have waited long for us as we went abroad for a long time. That s why I worked really hard to do well during the recording for this album and also during the time I went on tour, because I wanted to bring you guys better songs. Hope you ll enjoy it. Things will continue to change in the future, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for waiting for us. I love you.

There is no way I would become one of them
Who likes from here and likes from there
Saying "let s meet up once" or saying "oh why are you so pretty" 
Even though you are not mine anymore, I feel like something is being taken away from me

Before I realized the world had already stooped, but please tell me why I am still stuck in those times!
Ha ha... would you remember me I always wonder, wonder if I should press like or not
Repeating this so many times but your heart is still cold to me
It s almost like guillotine cutting me mercilessly but I still get close you like a ghost
I watch you re everyday and my heart scatters around everywhere

[Verse 1: Suga]
I WANNA BIG HOUSE, BIG CARS & BIG RINGS BUT, in fact, I DUN HAVE ANY BIG DREAMS. HA, I live comfortably. No one says anything so it works

[RM]
That's right, everyone THINKING LIKE just like me it became pitch black, then I didn't have any dreams. University  DON'T WORRY. I'LL GO if that's the case

[Jungkook]
It's ok MAMA, since I'll do whatever you say

[Verse 2: V]
What's the thing YOU dreamed of  Who's the guy in YOUR MIRROR  (I GOTTA SAY!)

[J-Hope]
My own WAY, GOTTA GO !! I'll be serious ONE DAY so gotta endure it, WANNA GO  DON'T LOOK BACK, other things apart from that are NO!

[Jungkook]
WHY don't you say anything  While saying you hate studying are you scared of leaving school HA  STILL do you WANNA go, yet  SO LET'S GET IT MAAN!! YOU'RE the one who doesn't do as told, MENTAL BOY of glass (STOP !!!) Try listening to YOURSELF, to the results you've made on your own

[ RM ]
TO ALL THE YOUNGSTERS WITHOUT DREAMSThank you Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF executive directors, and all the distinguished guests from across the world.

My name is Kim Namjoon, also known as RM, the leader of the group, BTS. It is an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion of such significance for today's young generation.

Last November, BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF built on our belief that true love first begins with loving yourself. We are partnering with UNICEF in the End Violence program to protect children and young people from all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their actions and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world.

And I d like to begin by talking about myself. I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea. It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky and wonder, and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a super hero who could save the world.

In an intro to one of our early albums, there s a line that says,  My heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten.  Looking back, I think that s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me, and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars. I stopped daydreaming. Instead, I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice, and started to listen to the voices of others.

No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped, and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.

But I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said,  Wake up, man, and listen to yourself.  But it took me quiet a long time to hear music calling my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles. Some people may not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn t give it all up. And I m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling like this.

BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now, but I am still an ordinary 24-year-old guy. If there s anything that I've achieved, it was only possible that I have my other BTS members right by my side, and because of the love and support that our ARMY fans all over the world make for us.

And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that ll be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, and for who I hope to become.

I d like to say one last thing: After releasing our Love Yourself albums and launching the  Love Myself  campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world. How our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.

So let s take all one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself.

I d like to ask all of you, What is your name  What excites you and makes your heart beat  Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you re from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.

Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.

I m Kim Namjoon, and also RM of BTS. I am an idol, and I am an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people, I ve made many and plenty mistakes in my life. I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I m going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I m starting to love myself gradually, just little by little.

What is your name 

Speak yourself.

Thank you very much.None[       Seesaw X I NEED U REMIX   ]

Then you'll go into a freefall
Then you'll go into a freefall

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
You say you just wanna be 'The Classic' like Nas 
Got nothin' to say, Nas hyung, u mad
Have you ever seen anything absurd like that, why just blindly insult right away
We can seduce other people's ears without using the F word
Got into YG with your rapping, dug yourself into a hole with your mic
'Last Farewell' really became your last farewell
You closed your eyes tight at the development in the music business but the public's eyes are paparazzi
You sold off all your hook songs, you might really be finished
Yeah and this is a real Brave Entertainment
Maybe DISS is what u want, our Special occasion
The facts that everyone knows but you, shall I stop 
Ok ok, no more jokes and will end it here

[Chorus]
The righteous BTS
The brave BTS
Then you'll go into a freefall
Then you'll go into a freefall
The righteous BTS
The brave BTS
Then you'll go into a freefall
Then you'll go into a freefall

[Verse 2: IRON]
Hyung, you'll go on a freefall very quickly
I can't understand this situation, could this be a dream 
I'll take the bait, now look closely
This isn't a playhouse, it's a real threat
Actually hoped for interest, but round and round we rotate
Quite a reversal, isn't it  'The Classic'  It's like a thief leaving clues behind
Who are you trying to fool when I can see through your copy machine skills 
Every song you produce sounds the same
You tried to act brave like your name states
Shit, I hope you realized you made a mistake, and you aimed your gun at the wrong direction
You're totally embarrassed of that one shot from your BB gun, right 
But I don't need to worry, I already wore my bulletproof vest (It's not a joke)

[Chorus]
The righteous BTS
The brave BTS
Then you'll go into a freefall
Then you'll go into a freefall
The righteous BTS
The brave BTS
Then you'll go into a freefall
Then you'll go into a freefall

[Verse 3: Supreme Boi]
Gimme a siren! My track is the 'Last Farewell' I'm sending you
You already know my counteraction, if you didn't know, that's a 'lie'
Ah! I'm a 'Invisible' boy who live in Bangtan
I am 17 years old, been doing music for half a year but my attitude is 'Not Young'
You 'Push Push' a button it's all the same trot
'All Day' like a machine Oh! You look like a factory
I'm so sick of that random machine noise
Just stop it! No matter what you say,every Bravesound songs sound the same
Just go 'round and round' how about doing arrangements for YG 
You're pretending nothing is wrong, pretending you're living well, but we all know you're embarrassed
Hyung, are you crazy..  Hitman.. leaves  Huh, are you kidding 
Hahaha, Look closely. Finally we'll see who'll go... Bye~![Intro: Jungkook]

ENGLISH
Inside this ending tune
I am standing alone
I want you to tell me
If it is over, let me know
Suddenly, from my eyes a drop of water flows
Without a rest again you rise
Love is like blooming cherry blossoms
It s like a dream, it burns like a firework and becomes ashes
Hey girl, I know the conclusion you made by yourself
Your hand that is hotter than the equator
Because of you, I bump into the repeat on top of the disappeared tune
Even the day that the melody should have ended it remains
Inside this ending tune
I am standing alone
I want you to tell me
If it is over, let me know
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
I know this is the last time but
I want to hear, even if it is only a word
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
It doesn t matter what
I just wanna know know know
I just wanna know know know
Only my lingering feelings remain
So I want you to let me know
Girl, let me know
The memories we made together disappears with time
The dominos fall together with it like Juliet and Romeo
Even if I fell in love with you desperately the heat between us won t cool
Even the photo of you that I turned over is beyond me, falling with the distant dream
You stole my stars and my sun
The only thing waiting me there is the darkness
If there are meetings, then there are bound to be farewells, never, ever 
There is no law written that says it then I won t accept it
That is my wish
Inside this ending tune
I am standing alone
I want you to tell me
If it is over, let me know
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
I know this is the last time but
I want to hear, even if it is only a word
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
I just wanna know know know
I just wanna know know know
Only my lingering feelings remain
So I want you to let me know
Girl, let me know
What happened to our wishes 
Life goes on even if the love to an end
It is not that I force myself
Because I know everything
But when I am alone all comes back to me
The emotions stir me inside
I face with you over and over again in my mind
That hand, that eye, everything even know is the same
Even know is the same
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
I know this is the last time but
I want to hear, even if it is only a word
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
Girl, let me know
It doesn t matter what
I just wanna know know know
I just wanna know know know
Only my lingering feelings remain
So I want you to let me know
Girl, let me know

YOU IN DANGER
YOU IN DANGER
YOU IN DANGER
YOU IN DANGER
As always you are only thinking about yourself
You are a one person duo
What am I, an accessory 
I don't know if I am your boyfriend or no! I am sick!
Is the unseen relationship of ours is a business
With me, is it not right 
Don don dig don don
I want you to change
I pray for this again today
We are like parallel lines
We are close but we don't interact
I don't care what ever you wish from me
You are everything
What happened   Why aren't you saying anything 
To my heart with sound but no beat
But she's so sweet I pray again for a miracle
Wishing not to get used to it
You are not here
But I want to see you
Almost breaking down
You are away
I can't take this anymore
With these
I don't want to deceive myself anymore
This is not right! This is not right! Are you fucking kidding me 
I quit being played around
I can't take it anymore
I can't hold it anymore
I can't hold it anymore
I don't stand getting played with anymore!
Again because of you 
Again because of you 
Again because of you 
I don't stand getting played with anymore!
Because of you I black out!
Because of you I black out!
Because of you I black out!
I don't stand getting played with anymore!
Look, No mood. Unlock. Around the world
My heart is still on search
You return my long messages only with 2 or 3 lines
I don't need that kind of mail
Where is our blooming love story 
There is no mail and all
But you are always only one word
Again I send you lots of massage and you cut Ban Ban
What  What  What am I to you 
That is you who always swing me around
You always just want just want
Our love is only a shape nothing more
I hold my fear with a serious burning feeling
I feel I am nothing without you
If I feel like this
It would have been better if it wasn't like this
I'm a love loser
You are not here
But I want to see you
Almost breaking down
You are away
I can't take this anymore
With these
I don't want to deceive myself anymore
This is not right! This is not right! Are you fucking kidding me 
I quit being played around
I can't take it anymore
I can't hold it anymore
I can't hold it anymore
I don't stand getting played with anymore!
Again because of you 
Again because of you 
Again because of you 
I don't stand getting played with anymore!
Because of you I black out!
Because of you I black out!
Because of you I black out!
I don't stand getting played with anymore!

Will these things make you happy 
Is it possible 
Always (Always) ON THE L NE (ON THE LINE)
Will these make everyone happy 
Is it possible 

[Jungkook]
Dreams disappeared and I became not able to breath
The circle of school, home and internet are my days
Everybody is same type
Who are pushed to succeed in life are forced to live between dreams and reality

[Suga]
Who is the one who turned us into machines 
Is it bad to not be on the top of the list 
We will show that the life only seen from surveillance cameras and borders
Are the real jungle
Who is the one who made us not be able to feel even pain 
What are you going to gain for making us do this 

[V]
Everybody tells me to endure a little more

[Jungkook]
It will all be fine after you reached the goal

[All]
Everybody Say No!

[Jungkook]
I can t bear it any longer
Live your life as it is shines as a light

[J-Hope]
I want to tear of my uniform
Make Money, Good Money these things seems normal to everyone
The numbers that written on papers becomes my unhappiness
The sighs that we took becomes our end

[RM]
Everyone pushes this as happiness to me
If it is really happiness than why am I feeling this uneasy 
There are lots of people outside who can t do anything besides studying
Who is going to take responsibility for turning us into puppets

Ice tea and a game of ping pong

Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along

The hero you've admired of since you were young
We used to jump, wanting to be that hero
But now we've grown and time has passed
You're becoming an adult 
But I WANNA REWIND
The times when the 10-year-old kid
Watched the anime innocently, and sung the theme song
I wanna go back so I close my eyes and scream
But nothing changes, it's just a dream

No matter who tries to stop me
I will go forward
Life is only once !
LET GO !
LET GO ! O-O-O !

No matter what happens
I'll not regret !
Let's go and fly to the sky !
LET'S JUMP!

2007 is when my life changed
It's been 7 years since that day
A killer of girls' hearts
But sometimes, I go back to those days
Facing myself, who was like something new
It's awake me until the future to be over
Now there is no more hesitation
Shout and jump like Jordan!

Rewind to that time
Taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
After that I purely satisfied only with that
When I dreamed about my sweet childhood
It was full of happiness
SO, CAN I BE THE ONE
JUST, I CAN BE THE ONE
THAT I STOP

LET'S JUMP AND DOWN!
We are HERE!
WE ARE BTS!
BEAT DOWN!
If you are ready, put your hands up high!
It's different from the dream that I saw when I were little
But finally I've seen, our evolution
The rapper who jump to the stage
We get it all !

Creating seven heroes's hope with full of problem and making a JUMP SOUND
Instead of a trampoline, the place I need to jump on is the stage, crazily, UP, DOWN
Without say anything, it's time to spread my wings and let's do it until end
LET'S GET IT STARTED !
Be confidence !
ROCK YOUR BODY now !
Throw it all !
LET'S GO PARTY !
