[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

Holding hands with my mama

Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage 
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one " I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]

Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that 
Imagine a world

[Verse 2]
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far 

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far 

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed[Verse 1]
It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Verse 2]
I'm g tting used to receiving
Still g tting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Bridge]
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah[Verse 1]
I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]

Here's the thing: you re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I m coming over. 

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin  and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]

Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh

Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin  from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Outro]

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby 
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you who starts a conversation like that " Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real  (Is this real )

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up

If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened  Why you "
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like  Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla  Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can t really miss you if I m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

Ah, hmm-mmm[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]

Now I m out here single, I don t really know what s next
But I ain t even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left

You're the one I m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don t normally say this but goddamn

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

I say, "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say, "You need to stop **** with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real ****," she say, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for  I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her

Then the mood change, then my name change
From 'Lil Wayne' to "Ooh, Wayne," oh Lord
She grinding on this Grande, oh Lord

And when it comes to that ****, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she says she single and I'm her feature

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

You'll miss your train and come stay with me

We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart

I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick

No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go  head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

And I find that it works every time

I'm too much in my head, did you notice 
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm 
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this 
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]

Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

[Chorus]
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious  (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious 

[Verse 2]
Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)

Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared

A question, something that I can't deny

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

'Cause I can't resist it no more[Verse 1]
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that s something can't be found

Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear 
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto  What's it worth 
I must be on, so clear to me

Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you

They wouldn t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you  (Got you, I got you)
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement  (What )
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (So swear)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting (What )
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary 
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

[Verse 2]
Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night

Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

I'm gonna be your new favorite
Tell 'em you closing the door
I am the only for sure

There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me on the west side for me
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me

[Verse 2]
I don't want it if it ain't your touch
It's better every time we chill

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love  Is it lust  Is it fear 
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere

Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me (Ah-ah-ah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care )
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year[Verse 1]
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point 
No 

[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

[Verse 2]
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold on me
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
I-I-I, ooh-ooh, uh
I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I don't care about it anymorePart I: Knew Better

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see right through you, boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together

[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me, "If he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him"
He used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Lovin' me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time (Shit)
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (Just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight (Sheesh)
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like

[Outro]

You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh
I wanna say we're going steady
Like it's 1954
No, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart[Verse 1]
Yeah, you really tried
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail

[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen 
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ooh
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

[Chorus]
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen 
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby

[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen 
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey
Taking it right back, baby
I'm taking it right back, hey[Verse 1]
Say you want me anyway, do ya 
You can handle all this fame, can ya 
Like me just the way I are
Just the way I, way I are, yeah, yeah
You would like me anyway, would ya 
You won't let me get away, won't ya 
Like me just the way I are
Say you don't wanna be a star, do you 

[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy "
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy

[Chorus]
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes, when it comes to love)
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you "

[Verse 2]
Cover on a magazine in just two weeks
"Boy to Watch", ain't he just, just too sweet 
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen
Woke up at like five, and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault, she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition 
Boy, remember where ya come from

[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night

How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you[Verse 1]
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said "I love you" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me

[Verse 2]
On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh-oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me

You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

[Chorus]

[Outro: Marjorie Grande & Frank Grande]
He was a man s man and a ladies man
18, 19, I began to become more serious about things in life
Oh, I think when I was standing on that stoop and I looked at him, yeah, I was 11 years old[Verse 1]
Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
No, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I try to explain it, I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah), baby

[Chorus]
(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby

[Bridge]
Straight up
You got me all in
How could I not be

That's why I keep saying

[Chorus]
(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's no one around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true 

[Pre-Chorus]
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't

[Verse 2]
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't

You can't forget me
Gave you the time of your life

Ain't got time to let them darken my day, that's right

[Pre-Chorus]
So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know

We could run away to only where we know
Boy, I got plans

So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt
Dance

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, but you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened

Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

But now you'll never know, you'll never know

[Bridge]
It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday

Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance 
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get  em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

With some decorations bought at Tiffany's

And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Welcome to this Christmas
Only comes one time a year, don't miss this
I just wanna welcome you to Christmas
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"[Verse 1]
Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in 
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

[Verse 2]
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

[Bridge]
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

[Breakdown]
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it

Baby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to do[Verse 1]
I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

[Verse 2]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it

We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble
When the line gets flat, gotta take it back to another level

[Pre-Chorus]
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

[Verse 1]
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one 
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change

[Verse 2]
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget 
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change

[Verse 1]
You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

[Pre-Chorus]
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

[Chorus]
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me

Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

[Chorus]
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin' 
Yeah nobody does it

If we give a little bit of love maybe we can change the world

[Verse 1]
You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking up to strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get the up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like, like, like

Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Ghandi, resurrect King
But if put our heads together we can do anything

You don't have to have much to show to show much care
Like give a wink, give a kiss
Like give a little happiness, like, like, like

Where do you turn 
When there s no one to turn to 
When it's so hard to cope
How can you start to make a change 
Maybe learn to
What do you need 
(Hope)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande with Jim Carrey]
Hope is the song
When the world is a menace
Hope is an open door
Maybe getting back up again is
What falls are for[Snippet]

He will if you won't get you a jada (Get you a jada)
Be there when I get home now
I don't know, what you've been told
But you should know 

[Verse 2]
That you don't fuck around with me
That you don't fuck around with me[Verse 1]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Refrain 1]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Refrain 2]
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I 

[Refrain 1]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Refrain 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly, hmm
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I 

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I [Snippet from the lyrics]

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Tell me why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you 
Why are you only

[Verse 1]
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

[Verse 2]
When he smiled, the girls went wild with ("oohs" and "aahs")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn 

[Verse 3]
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk 

[Verse 4]
Who put the glad in gladiator 
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre 
(Hercules!)
Is he bold 
Is he sweet 
My favorite flavor!

[Verse 5]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeedLyrics From Snippet

Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas

Let your heart believe that love is everything (Love is everything)

(Lots of joy and lots of cheer)
If you need a cost, if you need a reason, oh yeah
It's the gift that just won't disappear, won't disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
The truth is your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it
'Cause when I look around there's enough for everyone (Uh-huh)
If you spend a little time, look deep inside
Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas

[Chorus]
All we need is love (Give love, love, love, love)
Love is all we need (Give love, love, love, love)
Love underneath the tree, love is everything (Love is everything)
All we need is love (Give love, love, love, love)
Love is all we need (Give love, love, love, love)
Let your heart believe that love is everything (Love is everything)

[Bridge]
Love who you love, no one can judge
Follow your heart and don't give up
'Cause that's what this day's about
So grab 'em close and hold them in
And don't let go, 'cause Christmas is here

[Chorus]
(All we need is love) Give love
(Love is all we need) All we need
(Love underneath the tree) The tree
(Love is everything) Love is everything, baby
(All we need is love) Give love
(Love is all we need) All we need
(Let your heart believe) Believe
(Love is everything, love is everything) Love is everything, baby
(All we need is love) (Give love, love, love, love)
(Love is all we need) (Give love, love, love, love)
Yeah, no, no, baby
(Love underneath the tree, love is everything) Love is everything, oh, ooh
(All we need is love) (Give love, love, love, love)
(Love is all we need) Give love, love, love, love
(Let your heart believe that love is everything, love is everything, love is everything) Love is everything, ay

[Outro]
(All we need is love, love is all we need)
Give love, love, love, love, oh yeah
(Love underneath the tree)
Love is everything, baby
(Love is everything, love is everything)
(All you need is love) You need is love
(Give love, love, love, love)
(Give love, love, love, love )When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And when I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since, since birth
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb 
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded  No
He'll say to me, "I see who you truly are
A girl on whom I can rely"
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I

Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange
No father is not proud of you
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed
And this gift or this curse I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand in hand
The Wizard and I

One day, he'll say to me
"Elphaba, a girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior 
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be alright by you
If I de-greenify you "
And though of course, that's not important to me
"All right, why not " I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and...

Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy, I know
It sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me

And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'd be so happy, I could melt
And so it will be for the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else 'til I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's favorite team, oh
The Wizard and I[Intro: Ariana Grande]

Bought them red bottoms 'cuz she ain't walked out once
And I love the way you make me feel
My thirsty ex get no refill

Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

[Verse 2]
Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

[Chorus]
What about lies, Jamie 
What about things
That you swore to be true 
What about you, Jamie 
What about you 

[Verse 3]
Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

[Verse 4]
Go and hide, run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right

[Violin & Piano Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

[Bridge]
Jamie is over and where can I turn 
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

[Outro]
But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm still hurtingSnippet
Sober, when you come closer
Boy I know I know you've been trying to quit
But you let it show

[...]

Boy we're kissing now
Baby when I'm with you
I'm wasted

[...][Intro]
Higher... uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

[Chorus]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

[Verse 2]
Crazy, what we're doing: living, letting go (Go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know (No, no)
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

[Chorus]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper

You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher[Verse]
If I'm honest, I wasn t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching 
To this choir, to this atheist 
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(Just like mine, versions of these belong to you)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me)
They long to be close to you[Verse]
While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy

[Chorus]
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
And so I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy
He treats it
So well[Intro]
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

[Verse 1]
Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby 
Could you do that to me, yeah 
Would you lie to me, baby 
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy 
Leave my heart still at the door 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

[Interlude (Spoken)]
You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back

[Verse 2]
Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby 
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Yeah, yeah
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right

I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you

I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose

[Verse 2]
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
That you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me

Oh yeah, when you're, when you're gone
Oh yeah, yeah, when you're gone

It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young

Zooming up behind me

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do 
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need 
Won't you please bring my baby to me 

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Hi[Verse 1: Ariana Grande & Sia]
And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Sia]
We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
When you said, "Baby, I just want you to lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away"
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again 
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on, and ring, ring, ring, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy 

[Chorus: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]

[Verse 3: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]
See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (same old)
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave (oh)
I don't need to bring in all the attention (hey, yeah)
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention

Thank you
Do you mind if we change our costumes real fast 
We got these cute little custom jackets
It's cute 
Alright
What does this even say  It says...
It says "I want it, I got it"
Huh...
This sounds familiar, huh 
Dublin, does that sound familiar 
Do y'all know this song 
Alright, well, we're gonna need y'all to sing it as loud as you can
Are you ready 
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage 
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, sing
(Write what I sing, yeah) Yuh

[Pre-Chorus]
(My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy)
(Make big deposits, my gloss) Is poppin'
You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it, sing

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it)
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Woo, woo, woo, woo
(You like my hair ) Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I want, yep

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems, what 
(Must not have had enough money to solve 'em)
They say, "Which one " I say ("Nah, I want all of 'em")
Happiness is the same price as red-bottom, just kidding

[Pre-Chorus]
(My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin')
(The way it shine, I know you've seen it) You've seen it
(I bought a crib just for) Just for (The closet) the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, sing

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Ooh yeah, yeah
(You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it)
I see it, baby, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
Let's go

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Oh yeah, yeah
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Ooh yeah, yeah
(You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it)
I see it, baby, I want, yep[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie[Intro: "Video" Sample]
No matter what I'm wearing, I will always be
India.Arie
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me, mmm
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see
Hey, oh woah, baby

[Intro: Aaron Simon Gross & Ariana Grande]

And this album is for sophisticated consumers of art
Three and a half hours
What I was going to say is
Goodbye for now, the show's over, bye

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing

Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
Said, loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I wanna shout my mom and dad who are both here tonight
Everybody make some noise for my mom and dad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Part 2: My Favorite Things]

[Verse]
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Chorus]
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so-oh-oh-ooh

[Part 3: 7 rings]

[Intro]
(Dam-dum, dam-dum, yeah, ah-ah) [Laughter]
(Oh-woah-oh-oh-yeah-ey) (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles (Hmm)
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble (Oh-oh)
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines (Hmm)
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage  (Ah-ah)
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin 
You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain t gon' be no "Mrs." (Gon  be no "Mrs.")
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches (Oh, yeah)
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches (Riches)
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one " I say, "Nah, I want all of  em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms, yeah-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it

[Verse 3]
So gen', my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair  Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want, baby

[Part 4: thank u, next]

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle, holding hands with my momma
I'll be thanking my dad, 'cause he's really awesome
Only wanna do it once, real bad, gon' make that last
God forbid something happens, least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love, got so much patience
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)

If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

Who d'you think you're kiddin' 
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

[Chorus 1]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it  Uh-oh)
It's too clich 
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad 

[Chorus 1]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

[Verse 3]
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)

[Outro]
Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)

You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before

Spell "me" and "you" and add the two

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Chorus: Ariana, Elizabeth, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what 
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what 
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be goneNORTH AMERICA: LEG ONE.MARCH

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don t make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can t give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I m not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you re really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won t be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I ve been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Years Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna let him unwrap me, like oh-woo-oh
Get on top of him, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care )
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, mmm oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away, oh

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yores
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more, ooh

If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now[Intro: Nicki Minaj]

So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go  Did I leave it in the cold 
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Verse 2]
So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most 
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you 
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken messTBA[Verse 1]
I know you want what's best for me
I know you've been waiting patiently
You got my hand over the fire
I know you wanna take me higher

[Pre-Chrous]
I don't wanna jump until I'm sure
It's not like my heart is insecure
The moment I'm ready
I'll just know it
I'm gonna know it

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby, not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
You make it hard, boy to resist
A little more space
I must insist
Too close
You're intoxicating
Makes me wonder why I'm waiting

[Pre-Chrous]
I'll give up the fight
When I know it's right
Baby, baby, not tonight
Oh oh, a little more time
And I'll take you there

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love
Come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

[Bridge]
Only time can tell me if this is real
Or if we're rushing how we feel
Is it my imagination 
Is it a perfect situation 
No
I didn't wanna fall in love
But you made me go and do it
And now you gotta prove it
A little more time and I'll take you there

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Baby, not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time and I'll take you there

[Outro]
And I'm gonna take you there

A little more time and I'll take you there[Intro]
London, y'all ready to slow it down for me 
Come on

[Verse 1]
Said, you don't need a lot of money
And you don't have to play no games
Said, all I need is all your loving
To get the blood rushing through my veins, baby
I wanna say we're going steady, oh
Like it's 1954
No, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
No woah
Ooh, oh, baby
Woah-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh woah, hey

[Verse 2]

'Cause I'm way past that
So just call me if you want me
'Cause you got me and I'll show you
How much I want to be on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Oh woah
Ooh, oh babe
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling, let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Oh, no woah, yeah
Ooh, oh yeah
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande]
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Almost, almost is never enough (It's never enough, babe)
So close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough[Verse]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say  Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me  Yeah
Said, I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ah)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ah)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ah-ah)
Know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
Already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute 
It's impossible to ignore you
Why must you make me laugh so much 
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and...

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute 
It's impossible to ignore you, yeah yeah
Must you make me laugh so much 
It's bad enough, bad enough

[Verse 1]
Said, if you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far 

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
Said, I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so (Good to be needed)

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
So, sorry that I think I'm not enough (Mmm)
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
After all this damage, I can't help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far 

[Chorus]
I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Psychos[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me (Feel like a) dangerous woman

Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing, babe
I wanna savor, save it for later, the taste, the flavor
'Cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

There's people on the sidewalk, there's music in the air
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do

I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree

Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms
Keep from the cold night, you'll be safe and warm
We raise a glass together, to love that never dies
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes
There's no better time to be together
There's no sadder time to be alone
Hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
But I get to thinking, is this too good to be true 

[Pre-Chorus]
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't

[Verse 2]
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, hard to believe, bae
That the love you have is on-, is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget 
No, I can't, baby

Make everything taste like it is salt (Sweetener, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are (Sweetener, hey, hey, hey, the sweetener, hey)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Hey, hey, sweetener, hey, hey, hey)
(And then you) Let's go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]

(Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it)
(Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it)
(Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it)
You make me say oh (Sheesh), oh baby (Sheesh)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I like the way you lick the bowl (You lick the bowl, sheesh)
Somehow your method touches (Sheesh) my soul (Touches my soul, yeah)
It lifts me up to heights unknown, babe
So when they ask, "How's life " (Sheesh) I go (Sheesh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When life deals us cards (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Make everything taste like it is salt (Sweetener, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are (Sweetener, hey, hey, hey, the sweetener, hey)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Hey, hey, sweetener, hey, hey, hey)
(And then you) Yuh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
(Get it, get it, get it, get it) Yee
(Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it) Oh, baby
(Flip it, flip it, flip it)
You make me say oh (Sheesh), oh babe, yeah (Sheesh)
(Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it)
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix, yeah
(Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it)
You make me say oh, oh

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
And then we lay it back, oh shit, talk the rest of the night, okay
Things that we can light make me say oh (Sheesh), oh (Sheesh)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it s wrong or right
I am followin' you, babe, yee, yeah
Ayy, said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life
It'd be so sour (Sweetener, hey)
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
Life deals us cards (Hey, oh)
Everything tastes like it is salt (Sheesh, sheesh)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Hey, hey, hey)
(And then you) Ooh, baby

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
(Get it, get it, get it, get it) Yeah
(Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it) Shee
(Flip it, flip it, flip it)
You make me say oh (Sheesh), oh babe (Sheesh)
(Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it)
(Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it)
(Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it)
(You make me say oh) You make me say, oh

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh yeah
Uh, oh yeah
No, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, baby
Hey, yeah
Oh yeah, baby[Verse 1]
I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
Io coi jeans sempre uguali
Tu giacca Armani
Le firme sui muri
Tu capi firmati
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Tu i viaggi, i regali, le fedi nuziali
Noi al massimo a scambiarci le fedine penali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Mai stato un tipo da spiaggia o da bagnasciuga
Meglio l uomo con l uccello che con la tartaruga
Il tuo capo   firmato il mio capo   incazzato
Il tuo capo   firmato il mio capo   incazzato

And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby
Io sono diventato quello che hai sempre odiato
E sono diventato quello che hai sempre amato

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Bridge]
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah...
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't want to be without you

[Chorus]
So one last time (oh one last time!)
I need to be the one who takes you home (who takes you home, babe!)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go (I promise that, I'll let you go)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms, oh!
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah (ooh!)

[Outro]
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home[Verse]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to (Love me harder)
Come on, and if you really need me
(You gotta, gotta) Gotta, gotta
Got to love me, love me, baby (Lo-love me harder)
Let's go (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Love me, love me, love me, baby
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Harder, harder, harder
Baby, yeah (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Love me, love me, love me[Intro: Doug Middlebrook]
Here's the thing
You're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head
That you are trying to but cannot fix
Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself
I love you, this has gone on way too long
Enough is enough
I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over

[Verse 1]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seein' what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus]
Fallin', fallin', but I never thought you'd leave me
Fallin', fallin', needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't buddin'
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you (Uh)
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Outro]
Thought you were somebody else, you (You)
Thought you were somebody else, you[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side

[Instrumental Break]

[Break]
Got me walkin  side to side

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know 
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side[Intro]
Shee
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control, yeah
They keep tellin' me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
I keep givin' people blank stares, yeah
I'm so different when you're not there
It's like something out of Shakespeare
'Cause I'm really not here, not there

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy, baby
But every time I think I'm free
Come on, let's go

[Chorus]
You get high and (Call on the regular)
I get weak and (Fall like a teenager)
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me (Back to you )
Said, back to you, baby
(I get drunk, pre-) -Tend that I'm over it
(Self-destruct, show) Up like an idiot
(Why, oh why does) God keep bringing me back to you 

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah (I go back to you, back to you, back to you)
Back to you, oh (Back to you, back to you, back to you)
Said, back to you (I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time)
To you, you, baby, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Every timeIt doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
(M, M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe."
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say."

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
(Don't be, don't be, don't be)

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth

A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Love needs faith)

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient

Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby you were born this way

No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life

[Intro]
Come on girls
Do you believe in love 
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there 
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Chorus 2]
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

[Breakdown]
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I (Kiss you)
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be (N-A-S-A)

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yeah
(I'ma need space) Sing (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yeah
(I'ma need space) Woo (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align
Ah yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I (Kiss you)
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe, New York (N-A-S-A)

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space (I'ma, I'ma need)
You know I'm a star; space (I'ma need space), yee
(I'ma need space) Sing (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
(I'ma need space) I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star (Space, I'ma need space), yeah, baby
(I'ma need space) Yee (I'ma, I'ma need space [N-A-S-A])

[Bridge]
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
Ah yeah
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under, baby
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

[Outro]
I'd rather be alone tonight
Listen, Cory, I love you
But you can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Oh woah, hey
Nah, yeah, yeah

Na-na-na-na, after (After laughter comes tears)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I'm sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car 
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
Happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo (Ah), woo (Ah)

After what I've been through, I can't lie
Woo, baby (Ah), woo (Ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
Baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, baby (Ah, woo), oh (Ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Baby, yeah (Ah, woo)
Let's go

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake
Fuck a fake

[Bridge]
Say, if I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
(If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it)
(Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted)
(If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it)
(Neck roll with the attitude, yuh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I can't fake (Another smile)
Another smile (I can't fake like I'm alright)
Woo (Ah, woo), said oh (Ah)

Woo, Dublin
Put one hand up in the sky, come on

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile (Fake), smile (Yeah)[Snippet: will.i.am with Ariana Grande]
Started from the streets
Started making beats
Started from the bottom 'til the pinnacle
Ain't nobody, ain't no money, want a daddy[Intro]
Okay, yuh
You ready 
Where my "make up" stans at 
Right there, right here
Let me see y'all, let's go

[Verse 1]
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin' my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
Love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 2]
Energy and attitude don't really coincide
Stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops (Surprise, surprise)

[Chorus]
Said I love it when we make (Up, yeah-eh-eh)
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yeah-eh-eh)
(I love it when we make up, yeah-eh-eh)
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 3]
So promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life (Just like that Fenty Beauty kit)

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
Love it when we (Make up, yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Bridge]
Let me stay in my bag 'cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look (It's a match)
(Attitude, dream of mine) Dream of mine
(When you say that I'm right) Say that I'm right, baby
(And I find that it works every time)

[Chorus]
'Cause I love it when we (Make up, yeah-eh-eh)
Yeah, you love it when we make up
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup
(I love it when we make up, ah)
Said I love it when we
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yuh)
Go ahead, ruin my makeup, let's go

[Outro]
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
(Oh no, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah) Yuh[Intro]
You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice  Yeah, yeah
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Baby, you gotta take care of your body (Yuh, yuh yuh)
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we (Had to sit down and just write it)

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this  Oh woah, yeah
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down)
Is there such a ladder to get above this 
(Girl, what s wrong with you  Come back down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]
(This is for everybody)
(Babe, you gotta take care of your body)
Ooh baby, yeah (Ain't no time to deny it)
Oh yeah, come on (That is why we talking about it)
(Yeah, we talking about it)
(To deal with it, don't try to get by it)
Ooh yeah (Ain't no time to deny it)
Say yeah (So we had to sit down and just write it)

[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top
(You can feel it, feel it)
New York, put one hand up, come on
Just know that there s up and downs and there's drops
(You can feel it, feel it)

But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up

Okay, this, this
This one for my number one girl who got the top spot title

Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you 

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]

(You're so different, no one compares)
(And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there)
(I'll always be right there)You brought me up to my melting point
And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh

It s like you re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, you ll be packed up and be gone

Is it time I just let go 
Cause I can t do this on my own
Cause it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
I know I did it all for love

Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare
Oh, oh, blinded by your faulty truth
It didn t take me long to see through you
Oh, oh

It s like you re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling you ll be packed up and be gone

Is it time I just let go 
Cause I can t do this on my own
Cause it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
I know I did it all for love

I took off too fast
I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, I m shoving you down
There s nothing I need
When you re around

Is it time I just let go 
Cause I can t do this on my own
Cause it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain t right, no it ain t right
I know I did it all for love"When will people stop being offended by women showing skin / expressing sexuality  Men take their shirts off / express their sexuality onstage, in videos, on Instagram, anywhere they want to  All. The. Time. The double standard is so boring and exhausting. With all due respect, i think it's time you get your head out of your ass. [sic] Women can love their bodies too!!"
  responding to a commenter who said she was "like a whore" in her "Dangerous Woman" video, on Facebook

"The incredible double standard that we [women] face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, it's shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I don't think a male artist would be in this position right now. Sorry. If i'm speaking about something that I'm passionate about, I'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what I believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about."

"Is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between    Is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between    You need a little brushing up on equality over here."

"I have a long list of things I'd like to change   I think, judgement in general. Intolerance, meanness, double standards, misogyny, racism, sexism. You know, all that shit. There's lots we've got to get started on. That's what we need to focus on. We've got work to do."
  responding to the question "If you could use makeup or your phone one last time, what would you pick " on California's Power 106 FM

"I'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy, I'm not Big Sean's ex, I'm not Niall's new possible girl. I'm Ariana Grande."
  to The Sun

"What I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I   do not. Belong. To Anyone. But myself. And neither do you   I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating/ married/ attached to, having sex with (or not)/ seen with   but by their value as an individual. "

"[People] are so ignorant sometimes. Stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies. It's okay to be different ... to be curvy or to be thin. When did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies  We were having fun! Dancing on stage. 'What's she shaking tho   ' I'm shaking my pretty, cute, petite ass next to Nicki's pretty big booty. Both are f---ing awesome. How about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are  That [would] be nice. So tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down."
  on Instagram

"Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled 'After Black Power, Women's Liberation' and 46 years later   we're still not quite there yet! If a woman has lots of sex (or any sex for that matter)   she's a 'slut.' If a man has sex   HE'S. A. STUD. A BOSSSSSS. A KING. If a woman even talks about sex openly   she is shamed! But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used 'bitches'/ hoes'   how lovely) he's had   he is regaled. If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!! If a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated/celebrated."

('Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you)[Spoken Intro: Ariana Grande]
Ennu  mon am 
I know the problem look colossal
But if you can see me
How bad can things be 

[Verse 1: Jim Carrey, Ariana Grande, Katrin Kiner]
What do you do
When the barrel that carries you
Suddenly harries you
Stick together
What do you do when the bolt in the wood parts
Turn into no good parts
Stick together

[Chorus: Jim Carrey & Katrin Kiner]
Stay, stay sag an droop an drag
An rivets wear an tearsome
But we can still repair some

[Spoken Interlude 1: Ariana Grande, Puppet]
Now you try
My oh my

[Verse 2: Puppet, Katrin Kiner, Jim Carrey]
What should you do when you stuck on the drain
You should sing this refrain, stick together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy

[Spoken Interlude 2: Puppet Monster, Jim Carrey]
Now we pour a square
There there
Where 
There

[Verse 3: Bee Puppet, Ariana Grande, Jim Carrey. Katrin Kiner]
What should you do when your favorite comes
Needing repairs
Sing together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy

Spiffy riffy, fix in jiffy

[Bridge: Ariana Grande, Bread Monsters]
Make mistakes
For heavens sakes
We all commit the past friends
Let's fix that [ ] nose friend

Apart of no fun

Apart of no fun
We stick with glue on two by two
It's ten of one
Stick together, ten of one[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I m out here single, I don t really know what s next
But I ain t even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don t normally say this but goddamn

But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say, "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say, "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say you need a real nigga she said yes Lord
And what you need your ex for  I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac, shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
My name change from Lil Wayne to Oooh Wayne
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande
Oh Lord, I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love
She says she single and I'm her feature, oh my God

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lil Wayne]
(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)

Baby Loves:
[Intro]
Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'll rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do[Intro]
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

[Verse 1]
How did you know  It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it 
Can we settle down please 

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

[Interlude]
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

[Verse 2]
I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

[Bridge]
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

[Outro]
Just for now, just for now..."The first line of 'Focus' is: 'I know what I came to do and that ain't gonna change.' What I came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love, to share, to listen, to improve, to learn, to share music, to share experience, to share feelings, to make people feel happy and empowered," she explained.

"To make people feel like they're not alone. Without using my voice to do those things I would feel empty," she continued. "When I say 'focus on me' I'm not asking to be the center of attention. I'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice. By 'focus on me,' I literally mean focus on me. Focus on what I'm all about and what I believe in.

"The more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like, what we're wearing, our gender, our hairstyle, our sexuality, the color of our skin. But focus on each other on a soul level. The more we realize how much we have in common, the more we listen to each other, the more one we become."

The title of Ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since she's had such a tumultuous year (ahem, remember the donut incident ), but she insists this is about all of us.

"You judge because you don't focus on me, you don't focus on each other," she explained. "You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, you'll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you don't, this is who we are. What are we making fun of  What's there to make fun of  We should apologize for that."[Verse: Ariana]
Realizing you used to
Talk about what you won't do
Lighten up, cuz you got through
Come on, boo, we're talking 'bout you

[Verse: BIA]
Both found guilty behind closed doors
I'll let you see the real me, real me

'cause I m so into you, into you, into youSo the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are . I think that s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good

I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book   she wouldn t judge anybody by their appearance . she believed the best in people . she wasn t afraid of anything or anybody . she never let people s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted  she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)

One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way

So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some  dumb  kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us

Hopefully we ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)

Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted

Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started  you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We ve been through so much and you are still here  and we ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever[Intro]

Nothing to prove and
I'm bulletproof and

The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard babe to sleep at night

[Chorus 1]
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

[Verse 2]
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms and holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

[Chorus]
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
Promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too

Bright smile that always glows
Pearly whites with a button nose
And I knows, everyone s gonna love me now
Life on a the street  is a nail on the head

It's better than fixing the  roofing instead
The crowd will be packed, and they ll probably sing along
What a girl. What  a nice face, This is my song
I'm the biggest bang with the mostest zing

If you're the hand I'm the diamond ring
By the way, I'm even  the song and the dance
So give me one, give me one
I've already won
All I I need just one chance[Intro: RT]

[Verse: RT]
Okay,  this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you 
Boy,  you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus: RT]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right 
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I ll never let you go

[Chorus: RT]
You should know I m never gonna change
I m always gonna stay

You re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I m gonna stay right there
I ll always be right there

[Verse: YNK]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it s overkill
So, don t get mad at me 'cause you ve been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus: YNK]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it d be different
If you spoke, I would ve listened
But now, I m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

[Chorus: YNK]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn t know, so
Now you ll never know, you ll never know
You ll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You ll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You ll never know
Boy, you could ve been there for me
But now you ll never know, you ll never know

But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I m guessing I wasn't your type, hey

[Pre-Chorus: BYHRB]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: BYHRB]
Now that it s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river

[Verse 2: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause

[Bridge: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]

Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me  Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin'
You close your eyes and you're screamin'
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute 
It's impossible to ignore you, ah
Why must you make me laugh so much 
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute 
It's impossible to ignore you, ah
Why must you make me laugh so much 
It's bad enough we get along so well

Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there

Baby, I have no story to be told (huh)

Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong, but that's the way you turn me on
We got that hood love
We got that good love
Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisions

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
We got that hood love

Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad, boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad boy, you make me make bad decisionsPart I: Knew Better

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I see right through you, boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right 

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

[Outro]
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me...

Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right 
Yeah, I really love you

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

[Verse 2]
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right 
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
You should know I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay)
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

Tell me something I need to know

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: LMH]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)

Love me, love me, love me

[Verse 1: breathin]
Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus: breathin]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus: breathin]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

[Verse 2: breathin]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

[Pre-Chorus: breathin]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus: breathin]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one

        Released in 2019I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was mastered
By love (by love)
It's so hard (So hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (It's not hard)
So hard (So hard)
Real hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and
Take it through the night

Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling boy
And how I'm doing shit my way
If I got my piano, then I know I'd be okay, baby

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

So hold up and
Take it through the night

HAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....

what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.

I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled "After Black Power, Women's Liberation".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex (or any sex for that matter).... she's a "slut".
If a man has sex..... HE'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used "bitches"/"hoes"... how lovely) he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. "AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!".

I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with (or not) / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.

I want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.

One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.

"any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood." - Gloria Steinem[Intro]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna

[Verse]
How do I make the phone ring 
Why do I even care 
How are you all around me when you're not really there 
When you're not really there  Hey, yeah
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin 
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in 
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Interlude]
(Touch it, touch it, touch it)
Baby
Whoa, yeah
Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, oh no, babe

[Bridge]
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love 
Baby, let's be in love

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
(Ain't nobody gonna)
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (Behave)
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way, ooh
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it[Verse 1]
I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should ve fought it
At least I m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should ve done you better
'Cause you don t want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I ll let you go
(Baby, I don t care if you got her in your heart)
(Wake up in my arms)
Baby, I don t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Buildup]
(Her in my heart, her in my heart, her in my heart, her in my heart)
(Her in my, her in my, her in my, her in my)
(Her in, her in, her in, her in)
(My heart)

[Drop]
(Her in my heart)

[Verse 2]
I don t deserve it
I know I don t deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I ll make it worth it
Can t you forgive me 
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I ll let you go
(Baby, I don t care if you got her in your heart)
(All I really care is you wake up in my arms)
(One last time)
(I need to be the one who takes you home)

[Buildup]
(Baby, I don t care if you got her in your heart)
I know I should ve fought it
At least I m being honest
(Wake up in my arms)
Please stay with me a minute
I swear I ll make it worth it, yeah

I put that work on you everyday
When the night fall 'til the sun come up
You done fell in love with a bad guy
I don't compromise my passion
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be trippin' or makin' mistakes
I made too many in my past (that's right)
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage lovin' on you
Baby, like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby, rotate it

One time on Twitter, I heard Ariana was pregnant
So I got pregnant so we can pregnant at the same time
Turns out it was just a rumor

[Jonathan Bennett]
Ariana Grande told me my hair looks sexy pushed back
She's not wrong

[Stefanie Drummond]
Ariana broke off an engagement
So I found a guy to propose to me
And I broke off an engagement

[Troye Sivan]
I heard she's a lesbian now
And dating some chick called Aubrey
It's fucking sick

[Scott Nicholson]
I heard if you recorded her snoring
And play it backwards it sounds like fantasia

[Gabi DeMartino]
Ariana said, "honest to God knock me out"
So I decided to punch myself in the face
It was awesome

[Ariana Grande]
I mean, he was really cute you know 
He was really cute
And it was, it was really big

[Jennifer Coolidge]
Well, I've only gone out with one guy
That had a big front tooth
And I liked it 'cause he never got anything stuck in the front teeth
But, have you ever gone out with someone that had no teeth at all 

[Ariana Grande]
No

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

But the hard times are golden
Cause they all lead to better days

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

Baby don't you know

We decide it

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright

How do I make the phone ring 
Why do I even care 
How are you all around me, when you're not really there  (Mmm)
When you're not really there  (Ah, yeah, mmm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin 
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in 
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in
Ooh yeah
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath 
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget  (Oh, ayy)
Baby, let's just forget (Ooh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love 

[Chorus]
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall in love


[Verse 2]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I m out here single, I don t really know what s next
But I ain t even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don t normally say this but goddamn

[Verse 3]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

But the words can t even touch what s in my heart
No, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I try to explain it, I be sounding insane

All I want is love
All I need is love from you (from you)[Chorus]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

[Instrumental Drop][Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen 
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I m so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen 
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I m so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('cause I'm so into you)

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('cause I'm so into you)Love I have such a deep love in me for you
I love you more than anything
But words cannot touch what is in my heart
When I try to explain
I'm getting a little crazy
I cannot express
I retire
I can't explain how I feel
And I say love love
Oh love my love
Oh love
Love
Oh I'm trying to say that you are my everything
But every time I try to say they just copulate
And I say love love
Love I've never felt that way before
What I feel about you is unique
Keep, I belong to you
If possible
To tell you i love you so much
Words are not enough
Oh love my love
Oh love love
Oh I'm trying to tell you that you are my everything
But every time I try to tell you
They just get complicated
And I say love
Oh love
Love
Love
Oh ooh
Every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated
Every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated
Oh love my love
Oh love
Love
Love love
Love love
LaughI was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on)

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home[Intro]
All I need is to see your face

[Verse 1]
Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, ooh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

[Chorus]
And just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mm

[Post-Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, ooh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, yeah
All I need is to see your faceSnippet:

Just stay where we are, right here in the moment
I know we just met but...[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya

And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me 
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

[Pre-Hook: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got 
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know
But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

I can't resist it no more, moreSlow down, you crazy child
You're  so ambitious for a juvenile
But  then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid 

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about 
You'd  better cool it off before you burn it out
You've  got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day

But  you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When  will you realize, Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. you're right

You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied 
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you 

Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you 
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you Snippet:

        Such a shame to me to fall for the schemes
I was loving the script, but didn't work the scenes
Half way we walked to end up everything

So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

[pre Chorus]
You said you were giving up
That it wasn't working well
Thinking bout you every night and day
Used me just to show and tell

[Chorus]
Somethings gotta give to be happy
And I know it was only killing me
I was dying slowly with this dance
You pretended everything in this false romance

You did our love turn into a movie
Feels like is missing something in me
Lost you to love me, finally
Everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)

Now I don't believe in no one more
You hit me like a bullet to the core
Took me time to close this door
Our love is not something anymore (or maybe in here never existed love)

This is the last dance
I learn to take chances
I'm finally breathing, after drowned in this false romance

So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

Everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)

Oh romance, I fell so easily for your plans
It is so hard to live knowing that you'll never be back
But never had something between us it was all pretended
Now just last to us to be happy, we false romantics

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane

Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I see right through you  boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more  I ain't feelin' you no more)

Boy  you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do

Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me

[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right 

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure

One time, on Twitter
I heard Ariana was pregnant
So I got pregnant so we could be pregnant at the same time
Turns out it was just a rumor
Ariana Grande told me my hair looks sexy pushed back
She's not wrong
Ariana broke off an engagement
So I found a guy to propose me
And I broke off an engagement
I heard she's a lesbian now
And dating some chick called Aubrey
It's fucking sick
I heard that if you record her snoring
And play it backwards
It sounds like Fantasia
Ariana says honest to God knock me out
So I decided to punch myself in th  face
It was awesome

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Thought I'd  nd up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)

Mijn aanwezigheid is zoet en mijn aura is helder
Diamanten zijn goed voor mijn eetlust
Blijkbaar klikte het op een nacht
Alle demonen hielpen mij om dingen anders te zien
Dus wees niet verdrietig voor mij

[Pre-refrein]
Hoe ben je je tijd aan het doorbrengen  (Hoe )
Hoe ben je je tong aan het gebruiken  (Hoe )
Je maakt je zoveel zorgen om mijne (Mijn )
Je kan niet eens iets voor j zelf krijgen
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom, zo dom)
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom)

[Refrein]
Dus misschien moet je je mond houden, mmm
Ja, misschien moet je je mond houden
Zeg, als je nou je mond zou houden (Mmm)
Ja, dat klopt, je moet je mond houden (Ah)

[Vers 2]
Ik vibreer hoog en mijn cirkel is gezellig
Wij doen niet echt aan drugs en shit
Ik hou van het spel dus ik mis nooit
Ik hou de meningen stil voor de lol
Want ik hou van mijn shit (Mmm, ja)

[Pre-refrein]
Hoe ben je je tijd aan het doorbrengen  (Hoe )
Hoe ben je je tong aan het gebruiken  (Hoe )
Je maakt je zoveel zorgen om mijne (Mijne)
Je kan niet eens iets voor jezelf krijgen
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom, zo dom)
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom)

[Refrein]
Dus misschien moet je je mond houden, mmm
Ja, misschien moet je je mond houden
Zeg, als je nou je mond zou houden (Mmm)
Ja, dat klopt, je moet je mond houden (Ah)No lyrics to be found. Come back soon when there is some!Shhh baby before u get arousedNo lyrics[Bait 1]
Ini seperti kamu memiliki kekuatan super
Mengubah menitku menjadi jam
Kamu mendapat lebih dari 20/20, sayang
Terbuat dari kaca, caramu melihat melalui diriku
Kamu mengenalku lebih baik daripada diriku
Sepertinya tidak bisa menyembunyikan apa pun darimu
Bagaimana kamu menyentuh jiwaku dari luar
Resapi ego dan harga diriku

[Paduan Suara]
Aku ingin mencintaiku (Ooh)
Seperti kamu mencintaiku (Ooh)
Ooh, untuk semua kecantikanku dan semua keburukanku juga
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu
Aku ingin mempercayai diriku (Percayalah)
Seperti kamu mempercayaiku (Percayalah)
Ooh, karena tidak ada yang pernah mencintaiku sepertimu
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu

[Bait 2]
Aku mulai terbiasa menerima
Menjadi baik untuk tidak pergi
Aku akan mencintaimu meski aku takut (Oh, takut)
Belajar untuk bersyukur untuk diriku sendiri (Oh, oh, oh)
Kamu menyukai bibirku karena bibir ini mengatakan
Hal-hal yang selalu kita takuti
Aku bisa merasakannya mulai mereda
Belajar untuk percaya pada apa yang menjadi milikku

[Paduan Suara]
Aku ingin mencintaiku (Ooh)
Seperti kamu mencintaiku (Ooh)
Ooh, untuk semua kecantikanku dan semua keburukanku juga
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu
Aku ingin mempercayai diriku (Percayalah)
Seperti kamu mempercayaiku  (Percayalah)
Ooh, karena tidak ada yang pernah mencintaiku sepertimu
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu

[Bridge]
Aku tidak bisa percaya atau melihatnya sendiri
Ketahuilah bahwa aku tidak sabar
Tapi sekarang aku di sini, jatuh, jatuh
Membeku, perlahan mencair, membuatku benar
Aku tidak akan membuatmu menunggu, menunggu
Semua bebanku memudar dengan aman (bebanku memudar)
Dan jika mataku menipu diriku
Tidak akan membiarkannya menyimpang terlalu jauh

[Paduan Suara]
Aku ingin mencintai diriku (Ooh)
Seperti kamu mencintaiku (Ooh)
Ooh, untuk semua kecantikanku dan semua keburukanku juga
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu
Aku ingin mempercayai diriku, ooh (Percayalah)
Seperti kamu mempercayaiku, sayang (Percayalah)
Karena tidak ada yang pernah mencintaiku sepertimu
Aku ingin melihat diriku dari sudut pandangmu (Oh)
