[Intro]
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Refrain]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me  Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye" 
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

[Outro]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a)

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind 
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 2]
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong

No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling 

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I )
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I )
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart [Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do 
And I know I go all in, but why do I 

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you[Verse 1]
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree 
Don't you agree 
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree 
Don't you agree 

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me

All night, I'll riot with you

Living it up

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can t let me know I'm wanted
Can t let me in your head

But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you[Verse 1]
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here  (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening 
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Verse 2]
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening 
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Bridge]
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening 
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women[Verse 1]
In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning 
How can we go back to the beginning 
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning 

[Verse 2]
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin 
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning 
How can we go back to the beginning 
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning 

[Bridge]
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning 
How can we go back to the beginning 
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning [Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me

[Bridge: Both & Miguel]
Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Miguel & Both]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief

I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)[Intro: Take A Daytrip]
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya 
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension

What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise  Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall

Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Bridge]
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it 
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it 

[Breakdown]
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask 

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies 
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies 
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes, eh

[Bridge]
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies 
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Outro]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what 
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what 
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

[Outro]
Ah-ooh
My body, my body, my body (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
Yeah (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

Remember when we swam in the ocean 
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open 
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost  Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside 

[Chorus 1]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden 
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden 

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see 
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood 

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden 
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden 
Now I know what I know
But it s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go 
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This Garden of Eden 
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Verse 3]
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me 
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you 
Are you with me, honey 
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me 
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you 
Are you with me 

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden 
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden 
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go 
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden

This garden of Eden

Remember when we swam in the ocean 
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open 

[Chorus 3]
So are we leaving 
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden )
Are we leaving 
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden )

But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"

[Chorus 2]
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Outro]
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down[Verse 1]
Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah[Verse 1]
All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities 
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 2]
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Bridge]
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete 

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now 
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you[Verse 1]
Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that  Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that  Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me

You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

[Verse 2]
Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that  Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

[Outro]
Yeah
In my dreams
Yeah
In my dreams[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the truth's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out

[Chorus 1]
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all

[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me

[Outro]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here "
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest 
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck[Verse 1]
What would you do 
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new 
What would you feel 
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real 
What would you say 
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day 

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 2]
What do you need 
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed 
What do you hear 
What do you hear 
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near 
I made it pretty clear
What do you see 
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free 
You got a friend in me

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Bridge]
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear 
Maybe God does answer all your prayers[Verse 1]
You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside 
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh 
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2]
Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh 
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Bridge]
So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh 
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Good times, there gon' be some good times
'Member used to pull up, and let 'em fight 
That's that hood time
'Member used to hold on your hand when nobody would time 
Yeah, I know that bitch trippin', she ain't got that much time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She tryna copy my shit, but she be missin' the hits
Wanna go fast  Wanna race me 
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
We gon' fly through the stations
Come here bae, you're a blessin'
And from you, I learn my lesson
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
But she can't get it locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights, like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds, never stand still
Where you goin'  Why you ain't here 
You sold your soul for the mass appeal

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)

There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
We be ridin' like a mothafuckin' stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm colored red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God, I can't never sideline shorty
She, she said she likes all of my man's rhymes
Where is my phone  That money be callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summertime, me and shawty hustle
I swear to God, I'ma tip you, got to struggle
Baby girl, sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' baby, "I don't bite but my teeth do."
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free, Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)

[Outro: The Persuasions]
Real bad, baby
I can't afford the fancy, fancy places, oh
But long as you have faith in me
We'll have ourselves[Verse 1]
I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out 
In this life of sin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

[Verse 2]
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms,  cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

So say a prayer with me
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)

They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark (okay)
Some need the light
And some people like the dark (okay, yeah)

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse]
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Verse 2]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet  Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah[Verse 1: HWASA]

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est  a ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que  a amuse  
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
M me quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he never loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)

I got new rules, I count 'em, baby
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself, I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself[Verse 1]
Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness 
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish 
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish 
Can I just be selfish 

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna have to choose between you or having my freedom
Baby, I don't wanna let go of us or what I believe in
I don't wanna feel like I need to leave, don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
You know that I mean it, mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish 
Baby, I feel helpless
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish 
Can I just be selfish 

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely, oh oh yeah (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Bridge]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Just one thing that's on my mind)
Can I live my life if I give you mine 
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine 
(If I lose myself)

[Breakdown]
Ahh, if I lose myself
Ahh, yeah
If I give a little more of me
Would I lose myself completely 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely 
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Outro]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Oh, ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine 
(If I give you, if I give you, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine 
(If I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here 
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here 

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here 
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this 
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here 
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

[Outro]
Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here
Are we over here [Verse 1]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

[Chorus]
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

[Chorus]
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby[Intro]
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad
Real, real sad
Che-che-che-che-cherry

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me how this happen 
'Cause I'm goin' insane
I thought we were everlastin', how did it get this way 
You knew that this shit would hurt me
You cause my heart to break
You pulled this stunt a million times, but never quite this way

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say 
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way 
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame 
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back, gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you

I am not the one to tell you, how to live your life
But you can have my sloppy seconds, keepin' mine alright

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say 
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way 
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame 
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back, gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you

[Verse 1]
It ain't about the money, don't matter where you're from
Don't care 'bout what you believe in
Or who you wanna love
Let's get back to basics, before we turn to dust
Forget about all the illusions
Tonight it's us

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)

Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

[Verse 2]
Sweat drippin' out our body, that's how we shed our pain
The monsters waiting outside, like poison for the brain
Things get a little bit crazy, don't need to feel ashamed
There's no more time for cryin'
You can be our DJ
Play our worries away
You can be our savior
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

[Chorus]
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)

Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Trapped inside the rhythm world, I feel free
Let me be your prisoner
Suffocated by the beat, lets me breathe
Keep on lightin' me up, keep on lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you, need you)

Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Break]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn, (I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

The whole room stops
And it s not me to be one, to be one
One of many

I ve been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking

My friends are calling, since the morning
They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin'
But the only thing missin' is my clothes (Ooh)
My clothes (Ooh)

I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And you're right by my side, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Verse 2: Normani]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the floor with my sequin tears

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Normani]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke

And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me[Verse 1]
The more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial (Denial, denial)
And I'm so over you (You)
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

[Verse 2]
It's you and your ego that's fighting for the crown
Maybe that is just your insecurity
I gave you attention, left nothing for myself
And you threw it all away, and I said "Fuck that" (Fuck that)
Fuck that

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're being jealous

[Bridge]
Huh, turn it louder
Jealous, so jealous
You so jealous
Owww!

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
It's runnin' crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy[Verse 1]
What are we waiting for 
Are you in or out 
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh

Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit 
If so, help me now

If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It s cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

[Outro]
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, yeah)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, hmm)[Verse 1: Saweetie]
I've been winning since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you about to get much sicker
Cause I'm looking in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Beggin' baby, hands is poppin', wrists with six plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, taking meetings in L.A
Glowing up and blowing up, that's what I'm about to do
When it's all been happening since I left you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 4: Saweetie]
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel 
Sign off on our connection, and I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept a hundred, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realize you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur

[Bridge]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck[Intro]
Why's it so much better when we're not together 
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea 

[Verse 1]
Will you protect me from the things that I want 
Will you be down and leave the second we're done 
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together 
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea 

[Verse 2]
The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
(I got a bad idea, ha)

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together 
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea 

[Bridge]
No, I can't help myself (Ah)
Haha
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I don't care because I like it (I like it)
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
But I won't stop because I like it

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
(I got a bad idea)
It's a bad idea (No, no, no)
But I can't help myself (Help myself), no, I can't help myself (Help myself)
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself (Help myself), so I'll just help myself to you

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together 
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea 
Why's it so much better when we're not together  (Not together)
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea 
(I got a bad idea)[Verse 1]
If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Verse 2]
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Bridge]
When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight 

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone[Verse 1]
You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down[Verse 1]
Have you got color in your cheeks 
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth 
Are there some aces up your sleeve 
Have you no idea that you're in deep 
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep 
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know 
If this feeling flows both ways 
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can t say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few 
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts 
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know 
If this feeling flows both ways 
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can t say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few 
Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through[Couplet 1 : Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pr -refrain : Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Refrain : Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Couplet 2 : Gims]
Et depuis quelque temps nos relations n sont pas terribles
Pourtant, je te console comme on le voit dans les films
Comment tu veux qu j le prenne quand tu m appelles "mon ch ri"
Alors qu il y a quelques minutes on  tait comme sur un ring  
Et tu sais bien qu j aime pas qu on se prenne la t te devant nos amis
Alors prends ta veste et rejoins-moi tout de suite derri re la son-mai
J crois qu il est temps qu'on r colte tout ce qu on a sem 
Depuis toutes ces ann es, on s demandait o   a nous menait

[Couplet 3 : Dua Lipa]
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une derni re fois

[Refrain : Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est  a ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que  a amuse  
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
M me quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now

When I could shine like gold 
Why should I wait around and just sit here
When I could save my soul

'Til I'm seeing stars in my eyes

Homegirl on the road, she doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine

I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all those and their mothers want a relapse

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some

[Verse]
Came here just to sing for Clara
Lookin' for the baddest diva
Hol' up, let me analyse her, body lookin' like a hypnotiser
Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on
Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from 
Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one
I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic
Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic
They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket
That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder
Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana
Don't you wanna see the interior 

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some, oh hey

[Chorus 1]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much

And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe, hey

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done 
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some[Verse 1]
I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

[Chorus]
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

[Chorus]
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears[Verse 1]
Cab radio screaming
Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
Messed up, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline...
Mhmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus]
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us

[Pre-Chorus]
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus]
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

[Breakdown]
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey

Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster
Me and you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

It's such a cruel world

[Outro]
Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days[Verse 1]
See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point  I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go

[Verse 2]
I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

[Verse 3]
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

Thug love, thug love, thug love[Unreleased][Verse 1]
Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won t know what you re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That s just how I ll live my life
 Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Verse 2]
Another thing that he told me
"It s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He s the one I feel bad for
Don t have a passion like mine
I ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That s just how I ll live my life
 Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Bridge]
No matter what he said to me
I m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain t nothing stopping me
Ooh

[Chorus]
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
 Cause you know that
Nothing bout me s typical

You know I ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
What a year for dating, crazy
Nothin' is the way it was
People textin' exes sex pics
From the basement at their mom's

[Refrain: Dua Lipa & Both]
If you have human contact
Don't know what you'll contract
So your first date's always on Zoom (Oh)
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy

[Verse 2: James Corden & Dua Lipa]
There's no bars, there's no school
Poundin' Claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friend's

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When you've gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime

[Refrain: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
Now you're lookin' ready
Though, it's low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
If you're ever wanna see another person's body
If you zap on your forehead, you're a total hottie

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
Wear a mask, wash your hands
It's not like you have other plans
It's awkward, but it's cool
Following all these COVID rules (COVID rules)

[Bridge: Dua Lipa, James Corden & Both]
One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin' game
No one's seen you naked since February
And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new third base, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two:  Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans

[Outro: James Corden & Dua Lipa]
We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for dating[Verse 1]
I m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Verse 2]
Make my heart run back and forth
You re everything I want and more
I think you re down but I m not sure

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Verse 3]
I m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing had to zen me more
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You re everything I want and more
I think you re down but I m not sure

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that[Chorus]

Started questioning my life
Let s not talk about it, won t talk about it

I m waking up to messages
Don t recognize the name

While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of hope and dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

[Chorus]
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time (time, time)
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off

You said you'd be mine

Gangsta boy got me so mean

Let's wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette 
I promise you, you'll never forget
What feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder

My heart s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, I'm doing it, and you do it the best

Hold me for a little longer

Tell me things I always wanna hear
You're the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer

Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care

Don't you wear your own mouth 
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think you'd ever change 

I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care

And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesn't feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise

I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air

You are looking two faced
You need another pair of shades[Verse 1]
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
How can I judge you when you're with
Somebody else as long as you swear
You won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Verse 2]
No need to hide it
Come get what you want
This won't be a burden
If we both don't hold a grudge

Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Now you're holding this against me
Like I knew you would
I try my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look
Just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways

I-It's your voo...

[Verse 1]
I can't get away
Found a home in your heartbeat
I keep coming back again
There's a madness that surrounds me
And when you're a thousand miles away
I'm holding on for you
I get on my knees to pray
'Cause I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo

[Verse 2]
You're my heavy rain
You drench me off of nothing
For all you gotta say, at least can you mean something 
And when you're a thousand miles away, what am I supposed to do 
It's strange, 'cause your love stayed
I've fallen under you

[Chorus]
It's your voodoo

Now this is our last song, are you guys ready to party 
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me, c'mon

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in (Hey!)
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him
San Diego make some noise!
Thank you so much!
I love you, we love you and we'll be back
My name is Dua Lipa, I love you, goodnight[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Outro]
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell[Verse 1]
All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge]
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Funny, you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, I want you to stay
I want you to stay, I want you to stay[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I...

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning

I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
(Don't let him in, don't let him in - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself

I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself[Verse 1]
Diamonds leave me frozen cold
By now you should know me better (Better)
I would rather spend your time
I don't need these hollow treasures

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now
Look at me like you (Ooh)
You don't really care, you (Ooh)
I want you there, you (Ooh)
If you don't listen, man

[Chorus]
You gotta go
If you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (Ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money 'cause
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money but
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Even when I fall asleep I believe in simple pleasures
Maybe we're not meant to be
'Cause I don't need these precious metals

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now
Look at me like you (Ooh)
You don't really care, you (Ooh)
I want you there, you (Ooh)

Wait a minute, uh

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don t care
I m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don t know how it started
Now I'm boutta lose at all, but I can t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won t be safe
 Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God,  cause I can t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Post-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
I m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Could this be a revelation 
Tell me, is this what I need 
 Cause all this divine intervention
I m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design 
I know I didn t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I m so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won t be safe
 Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God,  cause I can t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
I m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can t control it

 Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God,  cause I can t control it
Wait a minute, uh

Set my soul on fire (Ooh)[Verse 1]
Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside

[Chorus]
I've got a fever, so can you check 
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check  (I've got a fever)

[Verse 2]
Every time you're close, I get out of breath
Wondering, wondering, wondering what'll happen next (Oh)
Is it my imagination  It's got my heart beat racing
Fallin' in, fallin' in, fallin' in, feel it in my ch st

[Chorus]
I've got a fever, so can you ch ck

Got me wondering what happened
I see them pictures of you laughing
I don't wanna run out of time to
Tell you how I feel about you

No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing

Try to believe I'm the one for you

Feels like we're all alone but we're here in a crowded room
Your eyes all on me and my eyes are looking right at you
Feels like I've known you for a lifetime but it's just day two
So into you (So into you)
Something about you in the way that you just say my name
It makes me wanna throw my hands up 'cause you know I'm game
Wanna unlock the movies I got playin' in my brain (In my brain)
Of you and me (Of you and me)

I needed to figure how
To keep get you here with me
Maybe you are my dream

What would I do without your smart mouth 
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
Got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind 
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections

Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you 
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh[Verse 1]
In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning 
How can we go back to the beginning 
Without you, I ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning 

[Verse 2]
Don t matter what s written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin 
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun stops rising

I need your touch
This is getting serious

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes

I want the facts, I don't want no more lies
I just wanna a chance to make it right

Tellin' me how much you miss me

Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
About you

[Chorus]
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me

What are we waiting for 
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)

(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Musical Breakdown]
(You, You)
(You, You)

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Interlude]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Interlude]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em

        [Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
If you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees, please
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

[Bridge]
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(Hey)

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me

[Verse 1]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
Baby that's, baby that's why I'm feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Everytime that you're next to me
I'm losing patience
So can we go, can we go all night long 

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Take the tension and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out 
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out 
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

[Chorus]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me

I'm numb and I'm broken, my wounds are so close
And I'm trying to tie a knot where the bar is still open tonight, tonight
Put the cup to my lessons, I speak without thinking
And it'll all disappear if I just keep on drinking tonight, tonight

Why am I dealing with our pain 
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change

'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight

'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else

[Verse 2]
Open my eyes and the sky is in mourning
A part of me died, but a new day is turning in light, in light
Confusion and heartache, I'm back where I started

Wait a minute, uh

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don t care
I m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared

Act of God, don t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can t control it

Could this be a revelation 
Tell me, is this what I need

But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)

Nothing can save me

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules (keep pushin')
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em,  I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em,  I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

[Bridge]
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Interlude]
See you tryna 
About you

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off

I turn tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don t make much sense
You're unable to calm down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you re so intense

[Pre-Chorus:]
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home

[Chorus:]
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn t work but it does
When it comes to us

Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

You re too playful, and never serious
But I love you that way, yeah I love you that way
I'm too careful and always in a rush
But it s all okay, yeah it's always okay

Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever

Begging me to beg for your love[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a...
(I'm a big boss and you a tiny man)
Shut up

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you[Intro]

[Verse 1]
After a few drinks, I start thinking about what we had
It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my [ ]
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I just want you to know
One, two

[Chorus]
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

And I don't know what to do
Do I come back with the pride that I have left 
'Cause I know you were the best

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I just want you to know
One, two

[Chorus]
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it

And if I could turn back time, I'd choose you
I wish you were mine
I didn't know then, but now I do

And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

        [Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me  Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye" 
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

I'm not where you left me at all, so

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me

If I would've known it, baby

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

        [Unreleased][Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all 
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise  Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall 

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall 

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet

I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

It's a new life[Verse 1]
I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And you're right by my side, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll b  dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you  ver (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Verse 2]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Bridge]
So baby don't you let go
Too good to be true and that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here

So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, danc  with me

I'm levitating
I'm levitating
All night, all night, all night
I'm levitating
I'm levitating

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby

        [Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya 
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Bridge]
Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu 

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell[Intro]
Inside

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind 
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

Ni-ni-night I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside

[Post-Chorus]
I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

I, I can't lie, I m scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all 
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise  Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall 

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan song

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart 
I should've stayed at home
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me  Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody (Somebody)
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me (Stop me)

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye" 
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Bridge]
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it 
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it

Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask 

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold  ach other, use each oth r, whisper pretty lies 
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies 
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window (Gonna break, gonna break)

Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease

'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down

I, I can't lie, I m scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothin' at all, nothin  at all 
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise  Oh
What is the point of doin' nothin' at all, watchin' it fall 

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
 Cause staying silent s the same as dyin'
I won t stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
It's a new life

Real fantasy, wishin' it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doin  nothin' at all, watchin' it fall

The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down

        [Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey)
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him[Intro]

Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know

I hallucinate when you call my name

Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

I would've stayed at home 'cause I (Woo)[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya 
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each oth r mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Pleas , come take it out on me

All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long

Was it worth it

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you[Intro]

        [Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why, sing

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees

Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down

Put my mind at eas 
Pretty please

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, (What do I say )
I tell myself

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again

[Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind 
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah[Verse: Dua Lipa]

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone

I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone

Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
You ain't getting over him[Verse 1]
Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling 

I would've stayed at home
I would've
Stayed at home

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time (I know)
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby (Baby)

Better alone[Verse 1]
Common love isn't for us

You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go

Now the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there
And I just want you to know

[Chorus]
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you

[Verse 2]
When I left ya, I left him in treasure
Cause now no one can measure, it's pressure
And I don't know what to do
Do I convay with the proud that I have left 
Cause I know you were the boss
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
One, two
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you
It's get over you

[Bridge]
Now I've come and died
And it fucking turn back till my chose you
I wish you were mine, I didn't know then but now I do

[Chorus]
That I still think about it
I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there 
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers 
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can t let me know I'm wanted
Can t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth  Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I m coming from, yeah

Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

[Chorus]

        [Verso 1]
Se que hace calor
S  que tenemos
Algo que el dinero no puede comprar
Luchando en ataques
Morder tu labio
Amar hasta altas horas de la noche

[Pre coro]
Dime que estoy demasiado loca
No puedes domesticarme, no puedes domesticarme
Dime que he cambiado
Pero soy la misma, la vieja yo
Dentro
 Oye!

[Coro]
Si no te gusta la forma en la que hablo,  por qu  estoy en tu mente 
Si no te gusta la forma en la que me balanceo, entonces termina tu copa de vino
Peleamos y discutimos, todav a me amar s ciegamente
Si no jodemos todo esto
Garantizado, puedo volar tu mente
 Mwah!

[Post-Coro]
Y esta noche estoy viva, no hay signo de d lar
Garantizado, puedo volar tu mente, mwah
Y esta noche estoy viva, no hay signo de d lar
Garantizado, puedo volar tu mente, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

[Verso 2]
Si, soy tan mala
Lo mejor que has tenido
Supongo que est s cavando el espect culo
Abre la puerta
Quieres algo m s
Cuando quieras irte, av same
